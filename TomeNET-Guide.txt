| Welcome to this guide!
| Although I'm trying, I give no guarantee that this guide
| a) contains really every detail/issue about TomeNET and
| b) is all the time 100% accurate on every occasion.
| Don't blame me if something differs or is missing; it shouldn't though.
| Please send in suggestions, criticism or comments to mail@c-blue.de.
| It's recommended to read this guide using a fixed-width font (Courier on
| MS Windows machines) to see proper spacing instead of warped tables.

(0) Quickstart
==============
(0.1) Start & play
------------------
-Get the latest client from www.tomenet.net or www.c-blue.de/rogue.html
 (called 'tomenet-???-client.zip') and extract it (to C:\Tomenet for example).
-Either run 'tomenet4-europe.bat' to directly connect to europe server
 (recommended), or run tomenet4.exe and choose a server (Enter 62.210.141.11
 to connect to europe server).
-Create a character, Half-Troll warrior is good for beginners.
 In case you choose Half-Troll warrior, read this:
  Good stats order for it is STR,CON,DEX,WIS,INT,CHR.
  Or, if the server allows to manually choose your stats, try this:
  STR 18/30, CON as high as possible, INT as low as possible,
  spare points into DEX, WIS or CHR. Explanation:
   CON affects your hit points, more CON -> more HP.
   STR (and DEX) determine your number of attacks per round. 18/30 in STR is
   enough to get 3 attacks per round with very light weapons, regardless of
   how you modify your DEX. To get the 3 blows per round (bpr) you'll need to
   sell your heavy sword and buy a light weapon (3.0 lbs or less) like dagger
   or whip. That is more efficient than 1 or 2 bpr with your original sword!
   Later on when your character becomes more powerful you can switch back to
   heavier weaponry.
   Warriors don't really need INT so you should reduce it to spend the points
   on other attributes. WIS isn't really needed either, but it can be useful
   to resist sanity-reducing effects.
-Make sure you choose [n]ormal mode (or [e]verlasting). Not 'fruit bat' :).
 Now you're in the game and should see the town (Bree) :)
-To chat, press the colon key ':' . Don't hesitate to ask other players
 if you have any problems with getting started.
-To run, press SHIFT+<direction key> where direction keys are on
 the number pad 7,8,9, 4,6, 1,2,3. Running often requires that
 numlock is turned off (press the 'num' key so the green light is off).
 If SHIFT+<direction> doesn't work on your system, you can press the dot '.'
 followed by a direction key. (If you use rogue-like keys, see section (0.2)!)
-You can wear/wield your armour/weapons by pressing 'w' and choosing them
 from your inventory which is displayed in the window labeled 'Recall'.
-You can pick up items if you stand on them and press 'g'.
-You can enter stairs down/upwards by standing on them and pressing the
 corresponding key '<' or '>'.
-Nearby the town there's often a 'newbie tower' which is a good place
 to start because if you die there nothing will happen except a slight
 loss of experience. Ask people where the '<' (tower entrance) is found.
-If you die outside of the newbie tower you will usually turn into a ghost.
 This ghost cant wear any items, so it's a good idea to care about being
 revived. To get revived, either visit the temple in town (it's a green '4')
 or ask another player to read a Scroll Of Life while standing next to you.
 While you're a ghost you can freely float up/down by pressing '<' and '>'.
-Press '?' to get an in-game help about keys and commands.
-If you have any journals like 'Guide to Middle Earth' or 'The Gazette' in
 your inventory (Recall window) you should read those by pressing 'r' to read.
-If your character gains a new level it also gains skill points. To distribute
 those, invoke the skill screen with 'G'. (See 3.9, 6.2 and 7.5.)
-If you don't like your character and want to delete it, you may commit
 suicide by pressing SHIFT+q or CTRL+c and double-confirming the following
 questions with 'y' and '@'.
-To drop items, privately chat with other players, or advance beyond a certain
 level you will need to ask an admin to 'validate' your account. To do so,
 send an email to the admin mentioning your account name, or ask an admin when
 he is online (Admin's names are displayed in dark blue in the chat).
 The e-mail address is usually mentioned in the server's intro screen or just
 ask fellow players for it.



(0.2) Command reference & key sets
----------------------------------
Can be different depending on OS / configuration.

Keys:
The first key is of the 'original Angband key set', the second key is of the
'rogue-like' key set. Some people prefer to use that one. You can change it
in the options menu, which you invoke with '=' key.


Walk into a direction:
    Original key set        Rogue-like key set      Rogue-like (running)
        7   8   9               y   k   u               Y   K   U
        4   5   6               h       l               H       L
        1   2   3               b   j   n               B   J   N

You can also use the arrow keys instead of the Numpad keys for movement.
Pressing '5' will cause you to spend a turn with doing nothing.

SHIFT+<direction key>
        runs into that direction. Numlock must probably be turned off,
        depending on your system.
        You can also run by pressing the dot '.' followed by a direction key.


i       i       display your inventory.
e       e       display your equipment.
I       I       inspects an item, showing its special abilities in case it
                has some. To examine an item you must either have bought it
                from a shop or *identified* it. Mages can learn *ID* spell
                "Greater Identify", some shops offer *ID* service, or you can
                use a scroll of *identify*. If the item hasn't been
                *identified* yet, you will only see basic information.
                See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID* and shops!
                If you examine weapons, it always tells you the weapon class
                (sword/hafted/axe/polearm) as well as if it's 1-, 2- or
                1,5-handed.
w       w       wear/wield an item from your inventory (weapons, armour,
                ammunition, tools, rings, amulets, etc).
t       T       take off items.
q       q       quaff a potion.
r       r       read a scroll.
E       E       eat. (Thunderlords, also known as Dragonriders, can eat
                firestones to gain temporary special abilities, see (5.9) .)
F       F       fuel your light source.
                Use oil for lanterns, and torches to fuel another torch.
f       t       fire.
v       v       throw.
b       (P)     browse (peruse) a book.
m       m       activate a skill (ie cast a magic spell or use an ability).
a       z       use (aim) a magic wand.
z       a       use (zap) a magic rod.
u       Z       use a magic staff.
g       g       pick up an item from the floor. You have to stand on the item
                to do that. You can also pick up an item by pressing '5' on
                the number pad while numlock is turned off. Gold is always
                picked up automatically.
C       C       see a character overview.
L,M     W,M     navigate on the map (use direction keys if using L).
s       s       search adjacent fields, objects or walls for hidden traps or
                doors.
S       #       enter 'search mode'. You will search your adjacent fields once
                each turn. If you stand next to a room and you want to find
                its hidden door, turn this on and run along its walls until
                you find it.
A       A       activate an item. Usually an artifact, a dragon scale mail or
                a ring of polymorphing (shapechanging).
T,+     CTRL+T  tunnel through an obstacle or a wall.
R       R       rest. Your hit points and mana will regenerate faster while
                resting.
o       o       open something.
c       c       close something.
d       d       drop an item.
$       $       drop some gold.
D       D       disarm a trap.
k       CTRL+D  destroy an item.
G       G       skills screen.
B       f       bash/force something (ie a stuck door).
l       x       look at a player/monster/object (use direction keys for
                targetting).
j               steal from monsters/players (pvp-stealing is not recommended).
U       O       use undead powers (use this if you died and became a ghost).
                Using these will drain your experience. If you ran out of
                experience points, your ghost fades away (= you character will
                be completely erased).
CTRL+S          spike a door (using iron spikes, the door will be jammed).

p       p       Concentrate on opening your mind for telekinesis.
                You need to open your mind in order to receive items from
                other players by telekinesis. If you are not concentrating,
                they will receive an according message, telling them that
                using telekinesis on you is currently not possible.
                Hit 'p' again to stop concentrating and close your mind.

h               buy/sell a house or change house parameters. See (4.10).
P               party screen. Form/disband/modify a party with other players
                here. In a party you will share experience points if you are
                within 7 character levels to each other and on the same
                dungeon/tower level respectively the same worldmap/wilderness
                sector. See (6.9) for details.
                For winners (queens/kings/empresses/emperors) the range is 10
                levels instead of 7.

/       in general use an item (combines q,r, etc..).
~       display further information of your character.
        Point (3) here is especially helpful for mimics:
        The number shown in round brackets before each monster name is the
        number they have to enter for their 'Polymorph self into..' ability!
X       quickly swap between two equippable items. They must be inscribed
        '@w0'.
{       inscribe an item.
}       remove inscription from an item.
_       drink from a fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
        Fountains can have good/bad/no effects. There is no fountain of death,
        neither one of detonations, so you won't get instakilled.
%       edit your macros.
=       edit your preferences. (Contains many obsolete effectless entries.)
        Most important entries here are..
        User Interface Options:
            "Rogue-like commands" will change your keyboard layout to
                the original Rogue key definitions.
        Disturbance Options:
            Note that most of these aren't available in multi-player and
            will be set server-side, so players can't change them.
        Game-Play Options:
            "Set 'AFK' mode automatically" will set you afk after some
                minutes of inactivity.
            "Flicker messages in recall" will allow you to see animated
                messages in the 'recall' window (message history).
        Efficiency Options:
            Mostly moved to server-side, hence obsolete.
        TomeNET Options:
            "Automatically open doors" makes your character try to open a door
                just by moving towards it.
            "Automatically disarm traps" makes your character try to disarm a
                trap just by stepping onto it.
            "Automatically tunnel walls" makes your character tunnel through a
                wall just by moving towards it.
            "Scroll the screen more frequently" helps to avoid death by
                attacks that came from off-screen. However, this option can be
                a bit irritating.
            "Always show lists in item/skill selection" will always show a
                list of possible choices if you use commands that require you
                to make a selection from a list of choices.
:       type a chat message. To whisper privately, enter <player>:<text>
        You can also enter a slash command here.
        For details about chat, see (2.3).
        For details about slash commands, see further below in this paragraph.
@       displays a list of players currently on the server.
'       lets you peek at the equipment of party members or players within
        sight.
<,>     go upstairs/downstairs. Press '>' to use a void gate (violet '+').
        Void jump gates teleport you to their counterpart and vice versa.
CTRL+P  view previous messages.
CTRL+O  view previous chat messages.
CTRL+X  save your character & quit the game.
Q or CTRL+C or CTRL+K
        lets your character commit suicide (permanently deletes it!).
        Characters who suicide won't drop items except for artifacts (if the
        server has ANTI_ARTS_HOARD enabled then no item at all will be
        dropped), nor will they keep the level static as it happens on a
        normal 'final death'.
?       invoke an in-game help screen
CTRL+R  redraw the screen (do this if it's messed up for some reason).

There are also some commands that can be entered with ':' like a chat line.
They all start with a slash '/':

/help       get a help about slash-commands.
/afk        toggle AFK (away from keyboard) mode if you have to take a
            quick break from playing. If your character is currently on the
            blacklist of merchants (because you got caught stealing from a
            shop!) your blacklist timer won't decrease while you're AFK!
            Note that your character won't need to consume food while afk if
            you are not already 'hungry' or even 'weak' from a lack of food!
/afk <msg>  You can specify a reason that will be displayed to the other
            players, so they know why you are currently AFK or when you will
            be back.
/page <player-name>     Sends beeps to that player to help you getting his
                        attention. (Can only be used if target player is afk).
/que        gives a quest! It needs to be fulfilled before a certain period
 (/quest)   of time passes. The player who completes it gets a great item
            as reward. It will appear right below the player on the ground.
/sip        drink from a fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
            Fountains can have good/bad/no effects. There is no fountain of
            death, neither one of detonations, so you won't get instakilled.
            (It's easier to press '_' instead of using the /sip command.)
/fill       fill an 'Empty Bottle' in your inventory with the water from a
            fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
/shout <text>
            Shout <text> loudly, will wake up and aggravate nearby monsters.

(The /empty function is currently disabled:)
/empty <inventory slot>
            Empty a potion from your inventory, leaving an empty bottle.
            Example: /empty c   (if you have 'c) 3 potions of boldness', one
            will be emptied and 2 remain at 'c) 2 potions of boldness'.))

/ig <player name>
 (/ignore)  ignores all chat messages from the specified player. (Toggle)
            Also silences all paging attempts from that player.
/ic         ignore all normal chat messages which are neither private messages
 (/ignchat) nor party messages. ('Private mode' will be displayed after the
            player's name in the player overview screen which can be invoked
            by pressing '@', indicating that this player currently cannot read
            normal chat messages.)
/dice       Roll some dice, you must specify a number of dice from 1 to 100.
            The result is random and can be seen by other players who stand
            nearby.
/dis        DESTROYS everything without (non-system) inscription in your
 (/dispose) inventory.
/rec -550   recalls you to -550ft, using an item inscribed {@R}.
/rec 32 32  recalls you to Bree (Town at 32,32 world map coordinates),
 (/recall)  using an item inscribed {RR}.
/dr         Wields all items in your inventory that are: not cursed,
 (/dress)   not {worthless}, not {terrible}, known to you.
/mar        Tells a prayer-user if he may use the prayer 'Holy Martyr'.
 (/martyr)
/note <account name>:<text>
            Leave a note to another player. Note: You have to specify his
            ACCOUNT NAME, not a character name. That way, no matter which of
            his characters he chooses to logon, he always gets the note.
            Important: Account names are case-sensitive.
/note <account name>
            Delete all pending notes that were addressed to that player.
/notes      Display all pending notes that you wrote to other players.
/notep <text>
            Leave a note to the party you own.
/noteg <text>
            Leave a note to the guild you own.



(0.3) Important inscriptions
----------------------------
All items:
    Inscribing an item with an '!' followed by a key will cause that key to
    cease working on the item anymore.
    Example: You inscribe a 'Scroll of Artifact Creation' this way:  !k!d
    Now you cannot destroy or drop the scroll anymore (keys to destroy and
    to drop an item are 'k' respectively 'd').
    You can inscribe an item by pressing '{' and uninscribe it with '}'.

The !* inscription:
    '*' is a 'wild card' which means it stands for multiple choices at once.
    Inscribing an item '!*' will prevent any of these action on it:
    drop (!d) / kill (!k) / throw it (!v) / take off (!t) / house operations
    (selling a key, '!h') / selling an item to a shop (!s).
    For example, if you wear an artifact and you want to avoid (d)ropping it,
    (t)aking it off or (v) throwing it away accidentally you could either
    inscribe it  !d!t!v  or just  !*  .
    '!*'  also implies  '!='  , so used on arrows it forces auto-pickup.

Items that induce random teleportation, like a 'ring of teleportation' or
'weapon of the thunderlords':
    If the item is _not cursed_ then you may inscribe it with two dots '..' to
    prevent it from teleporting you! In order for the inscription to take
    effect in case you already have it equipped you will need to take it off
    and wield it again.
    The two dots can appear anywhere in the inscription, as long as they are
    not separated from each other. Example:
    A Long Sword Of The Thunderlords (2d5) (+10,+15) {NxFAReg..}

Items that 'can cause Earthquakes':
    !E          will make the item stop causing earthquakes randomly on
                striking. (See (5.13) for more information.)

Word-Of-Recall scrolls:
    @R500       will teleport you to depth 500ft (tower).
    @R-350      will teleport you to depth -350ft (dungeon).
    @RW32,32    will teleport you to sector 32,32 on the worldmap (Bree).
                World map ranges from 0,0 to 63,63.
    You must've already been at that depth or deeper in order to teleport
    there via WoR!

Weapons:
    @Ox         Don't auto-retaliate with it. (The letter 'O', not the number)
                It's recommended for spell-casters who just wear a weapon to
                profit from its magical abilities to always inscribe it @Ox
                so it won't accidentally get destroyed when fighting a Nazgul
                and the auto-retaliator won't take over.

Ranged weapons:
    @O          Auto-retaliate with it (shooting ammo). ('O' is the letter)
                NOTE: @O must be on your ammunition, not on the bow!

Spellbooks:
    @Oc         You will auto-retaliate by casting the spell 'c)' from this
                book (or any other spell, change the inscription accordingly).
                IMPORTANT: If you cannot cast spells from the book or you
                inscribe an unsuitable item, auto-retaliation will be disabled
                completely!

Ammunition:
    !=          will make your character auto-pickup the ammo from the floor.
    !M          makes ammunition stacks of same base type and same ego power
                stack even if +hit or +dam enchantments are not equal. Those
                will be averaged and rounded downwards. (Doesn't work for
                cursed or artefact ammo.) Wield the !M stack first, then also
                wield the stack you want to merge with the equipped ammo.

An item that can be activated:
    @A1         pressing the keys 'A' and then '1' will activate that item.

A potion:
    @q3         pressing 'q' then '3' will quaff that potion.

A magic scroll:
    @r0         pressing the keys 'r' and '0' will read that scroll.

etc.. you get the idea. :)

You can also inscribe items just to remember their abilities. For example
if you find an armour that is an artifact, and you found out it resists
fire and acid, you might inscribe it {ResFire,ResAcid} so that you will
remember what it does just by looking at it and reading the inscription.
It can make your life easier if you wear lots of items that have different
resistances or abilities.



(0.4) Typical slang/abbreviations
---------------------------------
Art         Artifact from the a_info.txt file. Also called 'True Art'.
            (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)
Auto-ID     A special ability of some items. If you equip an item that grants
            you 'Auto-ID' all items you touch will automatically be
            identified! Items who grant their wielder Auto-Identification are
            highly sought after. Randart helmets or gloves sometimes have it.
BM          Black Market (Store '7').
Cheeze      Questionable action, not quite cheating but close to it.
            This can be transferring items to a store character (mule)
            or exploiting weaknesses in the game design instead of
            reporting them to the forum.
Dive        A trip into the dungeon, usually quite deep compared to the
            diver's character level.

Excellents  Items that pseudo-identified as 'excellent'.
FA          Free Action (immunity to paralysis).
FF          Feather falling (Levitation).
Gorth       Room in the dungeon, divided into 4 chambers. Similar to a pit.

            See (1.5) for details.
Party       A group of players who fight together and share experience.
            In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7
            character levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level
            respectively the same worldmap/wilderness sector.
Phase Door  A short-range teleportation.
Pseudo-ID   If a player keeps an unidentified item for a longer time he might
            'feel' if the item is average, good, cursed or special. The item
            will automatically receive a 'pseudo-id inscription' then.
            Pseudo-id intensity and speed depend on the 'Combat' skill.
Randart     Randomly generated artifact.
Res         Resistance.
Scumming    Repeatedly using staircases up/downwards to make a level become

            the same, permanently until it is unstaticed.
            All levels remain static for a short period of time after the
            last player leaves them to prevent scumming.
Unique      A monster that is named and exists only once (although it can
            respawn, each player will receive loot only once from it).
            Uniques often have large escorts.
WoR         Word-Of-Recall (teleports you into the dungeon and back or on the
            world map).
Wormy       Wormtongue, Agent of Saruman. He drops great items.



(0.5) Rumours, missing features, technical warnings (READ!)
-----------------------------------------------------------
-Usually characters expire (that means they are automatically deleted!)
 after 90 days of inactivity.
-Items on the ground (especially in towns) often disappear automatically after
 a few minutes. So don't use the town to 'store' loot.
-If you press CTRL+X to save&exit the game, you should do that in a safe town.
 Dungeons might change while you are logged off, and the next time you log on
 you might find yourself stuck inside a wall, where the previous dungeon had a
 wide room.
 Another problem is that if you don't leave in a town, your character will
 stay for another 20 seconds in the game before it finally disappears from the
 dungeon! If monsters were around, you might get killed easily during that
 20 seconds.
-The items you find don't depend on your race or class but on monster level
 and depth and luck.
-Spells/round is always 1, even if the number displayed is higher (raised by
 items that effect your 'Spell power' via SPELL flag).
-Don't drop artifacts inside houses if the server doesn't allow artifacts to
 be dropped inside player houses, or you will simply lose the artifact!
-Items on the floor within a house don't form piles! If you drop too many
 items and space in the house runs out the dropped item may just disappear!
-The massive iron crown of Morgoth must not be worn by non-Kings/Queens!
-Auto-retaliation with spell books is currently not working.
-Sometimes if you pick up an item from a pile, the next item below doesn't
 become visible on the map. You still 'feel' it if you step on the pile
 though. So if you died and were revived, scan your loot piles on the ground
 carefully to not miss one of your items at the bottom of a pile.
-Scrolls of House Creation don't work at this time and have been removed from
 the game since they had no effect except for generating cash by being sold
 to a shop.
-Undead powers (for players' ghosts) are not available at the moment.
-Several shops' features have not yet been implemented.
-Stealing from monsters is not possible.
-'LEVELS' and 'ULTIMATE' flag on unique items currently don't do anything.
-Two types of crashes might occur:
 a) Everyone is recalled to town. After a crash all levels will stay static
    for a short while, so you can recall back and grab loot or whatever.
 b) Players are not recalled. After you logged in again and find yourself in
    the dungeon, it is highly recommended to recall instantly. When another
    player enters that level, it can change its layouts/monsters completely
    even while you're still on it and you might find yourself in big trouble
    and sometimes unable to move. (In such cases rejoin and recall instantly.)



(1) Introduction
================
(1.1) What is TomeNET? (Where can I get the latest sources?)
------------------------------------------------------------
It's an extremely advanced online multiplayer rogue-like role-playing game,
derived from MAngband (Multiplayer-Angband). TomeNET bases on the stories of
J.R.R. Tolkien mainly "The Lord Of The Rings", hence the name "the Troubles of
Middle Earth" or alternatively "the Tales of Middle Earth". The final goal in
TomeNET is to destroy the fallen god Melkor who is known by the name of
Morgoth, Lord Of Darkness. The official website is http://www.tomenet.net/ .
Latest version and information also available at http://www.c-blue.de/rogue/ .

The source code was hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pernband,
module pm. Access it straight via CVS, avoid any snapshot tarballs and stuff.
Due to sourceforge's slowness TomeNET source is now accessible at a new
repository at http://angband.oook.cz/, see below.
The cvs command-line to download the latest sources and files for TomeNET is:
For sourceforge.net CVS (old):

(1.2) What is a rogue-like game?
--------------------------------
Rogue was a game basing only on alpha-numerical characters, like letters and
numbers. It didn't have any graphics. Thus it could run on basically every
simple computer. However it was not a text-adventure. Its game engine provides
a grid for turn-by-turn movement and combat that the user looks at from high
above. Here is a small "screenshot":
...............
...########....
...#$.....#....
...#..@...'....
...#......#....
...########.p..
...............
The @ is usually the player, the dots are empty fields. The # are walls. Here
the player seems to be inside a building. In the upper-left corner some money
is deposited. The ' is an open door. Outside of the building there is a p,
which is usually some townsfolk. They are not always friendly and some tend to
steal! Rogue was the first game of this kind, hence all games working with
similar graphics and game engine are called rogue-likes.
Other well-known rogue-likes are Nethack, Larn, Moria, Angband.

(1.4) Goal and progress of TomeNET players
------------------------------------------
The final goal that a brave adventurer could possible seek in TomeNET is to
become King respectively Queen. To acquire this he or she must destroy the
fallen god Melkor who is known by the name of Morgoth, Lord Of Darkness.
Morgoth is said to reside deep within the dungeons at around 5000 feet down in
the earth. Getting there will be an extraordinary journey bearing unbelievable
dangers but also fantastic treasure. Players on the same server can also play
together by forming parties and sharing their experience! Players will acquire
new ranks as their experience grows, allowing them to learn new abilities and
to become stronger. Morgoth is said not to show up until his servant Sauron,
the sorceror has been killed. (See 1.5 for more information about Morgoth.)



(1.5) Morgoth and the Nazgul
----------------------------
Morgoth, The Lord Of Darkness commands nine Ring Wraiths, called 'Nazgul'.
These corrupted souls of former ring-wearers are named..
Uvatha the Horseman, Adunaphel the Quiet, Akhorahil the Blind,
Ren the Unclean, Ji Indur Dawndeath, Dwar Dog Lord of Waw, Hoarmurath of Dir,
Khamul the Black Easterling and the Witch-king of Angmar.
Morgoth has the ability to summon these, so you should destroy them all
before facing him.

Morgoth is also able to summon all other unique beings, so one of your tasks
to prevail against him will be to kill off as many of the powerful unique foes
as you can before facing him.

Morgoth, the god of destruction, has reinforced his surroundings to be
especially devastating to all living beings:
If you get killed on a level where Morgoth, The Lord Of Darkness walks, your
ghost will be destroyed too, even if you are everlasting! Beware!

A very dangerous thing about Nazgul is that weapons get quickly destroyed if
they come in contact with these corrupted beings.
If you are a spell-caster who doesn't use his weapon to fight but just to
profit from its magical abilities then it's strongly recommended to inscribe
the weapon @Ox to avoid auto-retaliation, see (0.3) about inscriptions and
(4.1) about auto-retaliation.
If you rely on melee weapons you must try to get your hands on an artifact
since these resist Nazgul greatly!
Dark Swords and ego weapons also have a certain chance to resist destruction,
ego Dark Swords are the best non-artifact weapons against Nazgul.
(It doesn't matter if the artifact is a random or a static one.)

If you come in contact with a Nazgul or a very powerful undead creature there
is a chance that you will be infected by the Black Breath. This dark aura is
able to infect other players if you come too close to them. It will drain your
stats and permanently drain your experience. Slowly, but steadily. There are
several possibilities to cure Black Breath, for example Sprigs of Athelas.



(1.6) How to encounter the final boss: Morgoth, The Lord Of Darkness
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-Morgoth is found only at dungeon level 100 or deeper.
-He won't show up until you killed Sauron, The Sorceror (at dungeon level 99).
-Morgoth and Sauron do not neccessarily spawn on each fitting dungeon level,
sometimes you have to look a bit for him, like for all other monsters/uniques.
-If a player who hasn't killed Sauron yet or who has already beaten Morgoth
enters a dungeon level where Morgoth is currently on, Morgoth will instantly
teleport to a different dungeon level.
-If there's already another player on that level who has beaten Sauron but
hasn't acquired the title of a King or Queen yet, the 'intruder' player will
be teleported to town instead and Morgoth will remain on the level.
-If a party of players encounters him he will be a bit thougher than
he appears to a solo player, depending on the size of the party.
-There are hardly any walls that can hold Morgoth back for long.

See (1.5) for more information about Morgoth.

There are rumours of even more powerful beings than the Lord Of Darkness.
Kings and Queens who seek new challenges shall try to enter the Nether Realm,
a dungeon with dangers beyond imagination. Only those who destroyed Morgoth
may enter. The Nether Realm can be very rewarding in terms of experience but
also very deadly. Terrible foes are said to dwell there which aren't seen in
the mundane world.



(2) Installation & setup
========================
(2.1) Installing TomeNET
------------------------
Go to http://www.c-blue.de/rogue.html , download the latest client (version
number sometimes stays the same although a minor update was made, it's at
least 4.0.0 though).
Extract it to a new directory, preserving the pathnames.
You may edit the file "tomenet4.ini" and do some changes to your likings.
If it's not already disabled by default, it is recommended to turn off
graphics ("GRAPHICS=0"). Further you can specify an account name and password
of your own choice. That will relieve you from entering them every time
you join a TomeNET internet server.



(2.2) Starting TomeNET and getting to play on an internet server
----------------------------------------------------------------
To start the TomeNET client, run "tomenet4.exe".
Now TomeNET tries to connect to a meta-server which contains a list of all
available TomeNET internet servers.
After the meta-server has been queried, the list of available servers will
appear in the main window. Choose a server that is near to your location to
avoid high latency. 
This step is reported to often cause problems under Windows XP. If you don't
see that list, or if other problems occur, see (8.5) for possible solutions.
Now you will be prompted to enter your account name and password. You can
choose these freely, the server will save that information and use it to
remember which characters belonged to you the next time you log on.
IMPORTANT: If you get kicked out with an error message after entering account
and password, it's likely because that account name is already in use by
someone else so your password was recognized as 'incorrect' since it was most
likely different from that user's password. Just try a different account name.
A player usually has exactly one account that can hold up to 7 characters.
In most cases newly created accounts have to be "validated" by a server
administrator to enable you to use the whole functionality of TomeNET. For
example it is common not to allow unvalidated players to drop items or money
to the ground. This is done to prevent certain cases of abuse.
If you accidentally chose an account name or character name which was already
taken by another player, you will be disconnected with an error message. In
that case, try again with different names.
Now that you have logged in you can create a new player character which will
represent you in the virtual world of Middle Earth!
Player characters are identified by 3 names:
-Nickname (character's name)
-Realname (account name)
-Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
The hostname is not really important. However, make sure that all of these 3
names may only consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and all other characters
with an ASCII code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
The realname and hostname must not be empty. The nickname (character name)
needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z').

To drop items, privately chat with other players, or advance beyond a certain
level you will need to ask an admin to 'validate' your account. To do so,
send an email to the admin mentioning your account name, or ask an admin when
he is online (Admin's names are displayed in dark blue in the chat).
The e-mail address is usually mentioned in the server's intro screen or just
ask fellow players for it.



(2.3) Behaviour and chat messages
---------------------------------
You can chat with other players by pressing the colon key ':' once you have
joined a game with your character.
In general, don't hesitate to ask questions. Players are usually willing to
help you with the beginnings. Keep in mind that the message window is flooded
with status messages if a player is in combat, that means if you write to
someone while he is fighting monsters he most likely won't notice your
message. Politely try again after some time.
You can scroll back the messages using CTRL+P, or look at chat-only messages
using CTRL+O.

You can also enter slash commands in the chat line. For details about slash
commands see (0.2).

To type a private message to someone, enter <name>:<text>
Example:    Hi!             <- goes to everyone
            C. Blue:Hi!     <- goes privately to the character named 'C. Blue'
In chat messages you can type a double colon '::' to force output of a normal
colon ':' instead of having it interpreted as separator for a private chat
message. Most smileys are recognized automatically and don't require you to
enter a double colon ( ':)' will work equally to '::)' ). (If you want to send
a private message to someone which starts with a smiley, you will have to
enter a space between the private-separator colon and the smiley colon,
example: 'd00d: :)' sends a private message to d00d, containing  ' :)'
while 'd00d::)' will result in a public chat message looking like this
'd00d:)' .)

You can use colours in messages. To change the message colour, put a {
followed by a colour code somewhere into your message line.
Example:
        {pHi!               <- results in a 'poison-coloured' Hi!
        I see some {vh {Bto the east
                            <- results in "I see some h in the east"
                               where the 'h' is violet. The rest of the
                               message is light blue (standard colour).
If you cannot see coloured messages in your secondary Tomenet windows other
than the big main window, check your client option settings by typing  =3
and looking for 'Flicker messages in recall' (recall_flicker). Set it to
'yes'.
If you want to type the character '{' in a chat message, rather than using
it for a colour code, type it twice '{{'. It will become '{'.

Here is a list of colour codes (try not to annoy your fellow players :)
    d   black           b   blue            B   light blue
    D   dark            g   green           G   light green
    s   slate           r   red             R   light red (pink)
    W   white           u   umber           U   light umber
    w   bright white    y   yellow          o   orange          v   violet

    a   acidic          c   cold            e   electric        f   fire
    p   poison          L   light flicker   h   half-multi      m   multi


Character names in chat lines have different colours to indicate their status:

Light blue      Normal / everlasting player.
Light grey      Hard-mode player.
Dark grey       No-ghost / hellish player.
Violet          Player character is king / queen.
Dark blue       Player is admin.



(3) Creating a character & starting to play
===========================================
(3.1) Creating a new character; character modes
-----------------------------------------------
First you may choose your gender. This will not have actual influence on your
strengths or weaknesses.
Now you have to choose your race. Humans are good allrounders, while the other
races are more or less specialized. For example half-trolls are usually quite
dumb but very strong, and hobbits are quite nimble and intelligent but not
very strong. For more information look at the official website
http://www.tomenet.net/ where you will find descriptions of all races and
classes.
A half-troll warrior might be the best choice for a beginner to try since he
is tough and has less chance of dying instantly in case you make a more
serious mistake. Also you don't have to worry about the spell-casting system
for now. So choose your class, also called profession. Wizards are physically
weaker but cast spells the better the higher their intelligence is, so
choosing a race that is very intelligent might be a good idea, while a race
with high strength and constitution will be fitting a warrior profession.
Now you will see your six basic attributes STRength, INTelligence, WISdom,
DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma.

Depending on the server configuration, starting at TomeNET version 4.2.0,
there are 2 alternative stages of character creation that may follow now.

1) The old way - random stats:
You see the short names for the 6 stats written from the left to the right
on the very bottom of the screen, and you're asked to choose a stat order.
You have to determine how important each of the 6 stats is to you by defining
an order. The first attribute you choose will be raised most.
However, know that all your stats are randomly modified slightly, each
character that you create even with same race and class will be a bit
different. Sometimes you are lucky and get really high attributes at the
beginning. And sometimes you get more gold to start with. If you don't like
the resulting stats after you finished character creation, suicide and start
over.

2) The new way since 4.2.0 - chosen stats:
You see your 6 stats written below each other, followed by a base number (10).
Right above them you see your free points (30) that you may distribute on the
stats. Use the numpad (numlock turned on) to navigate and increase or decrease
your stats until you used up all free points. Hit ESC when you're happy with
your choice.

Now you can choose a difficulty level you wish to play on. Options are
n) Normal  f) Fruit bat  g) no Ghost  h) Hard  H) Hellish e) Everlasting
It is recommended that you choose either n) to play a normal character or g)
to play a normal character without a ghost.
You can also choose e), that will give your character an infinite amount of
resurrecionts, while 'normal' characters often have a limited amount of lives
(depending on the server configuration).


'Normal':
---------
A normal character will turn into a ghost if he dies. The ghost can be revived
by either visiting a temple or another living player using a magic scroll of
life when standing adjacent to the ghost. The ghost will return to the world
of living under the cost of a lot of experience but at least the player can
resume playing. If the ghost dies, the character will finally be erased
permanently, watch out!
Depending on the server configuration the number of times a ghost is limited,
standard is 3 lifes.
(Outdated/wrong: If a normal player becomes a queen or king (defeats Morgoth),
all remaining resurrections will be lost and the next time he dies it will be
permanent, like it is for unworldly characters.)

'Everlasting':
--------------
Create an everlasting character for an infinite amount of resurrections.
Everlasting characters can become king/queen, but cannot enter the high-score.
Other character types cannot use items that belong to everlasting
characters. Non-everlasting and everlasting characters can't be in the same
party.
If an everlasting King/Queen dies, he won't be destroyed but lose the
King/Queen status. To regain it, he needs to find another player who hasn't
killed Sauron and Morgoth yet and team up with him, because those two won't
(re)spawn for the everlasting player.

'Unworldly' (no-ghost) and 'Hellish' (no-ghost + hard):
-------------------------------------------------------
A character without a ghost, as well as hellish characters (who basically are
a combination of 'no-ghost' and 'hard') will be annihilated and deleted
completely on death.

'Hard' and 'Hellish':
---------------------
Hard characters and hellish characters get certain penalties in gameplay.
These are:
-losing -1 to all stats
-healing is reduced by 25%
-AC is reduced by 50%
-ESP only works within radius of 20 squares
-any speed changes above or below +0 are reduced by 50%
-max number of melee attacks per round is reduced by 1.

'Fruit bat' (Batty):
--------------------
A fruit bat is like a normal character, just not in humanoid shape but in bat
form! Fruit bats usually can take way less damage than normal characters
before they die, and they cannot wear certain equipment like boots, gloves or
weapons. However they are twice as fast and hard to hit. Fruit bats are said
to make good explorers.


Hard / Unworldly characters will receive 25% bonus on their high score.
Hellish (Hard + Unworldly) characters receive 50% bonus on their high score.

Note that race and class will have influence on how much experience you will
need to gain a new character level. For example, High-Elves already know a
lot, so experience is hard to gain for them. In fact they will need 130% more
experience than a human.

Creation of your character is now finished and you are asked to press a key to
start the actual game. Do so and take a minute to read the text that will
appear. It is called news or motd (message of the day) and often contains
important server-specific information or announcements to the players.



(3.2) The display (user-interface)
----------------------------------
After you logged in with a character you will now see yourself (you are the
'@' symbol) in the town of Bree in the main window. You can move around in all
8 directions by using the number pad keys! You can run by pressing the SHIFT
key together with a direction key. You can pickup items with 'g'.
The "Choice" window will give an overview of your character attributes and
miscellanous abilities. The "Recall" window will show the contents of your
backpack, also called inventory. All characters except ghosts have a backpack.
The "Mirror" window will show status or chat messages from the server or from
fellow players. If the "Choice"/"Recall"/"Mirror" windows stay empty, see
(8.5) for possible solutions.
To the left border in the main window you see a short overview of your most
important stats, starting with your race, your class and your current title
(the title will change as you gain experience levels by fighting monsters),
followed by your current character level, your amount of experience and your
cash ('Au' stands for Aurum, latin for gold), your 6 character attributes,
your current sanity (sound means you are completely sane, this might drop, for
example if a mindcrafter blasts your mind with psionic energy, leaving you
mad), then comes your Armor Class (AC) which describes you well you are
protected by all the armor you currently wear. The last four values are most
important and will change all the time while fighting monsters.
They are your theoretical maximum of Hit Points (HP) and Spell Points (SP) as
well as the current values of those.
Spell points are very important for wizards, since they determine which spells
and how many of them you can cast. The current hit points (Cur HP) tell you if
you are injured. If they drop below zero you die!
If they are the same as your Max HP then you are fully rested and physically
healed. By the way: If you enter the game and find that you don't like your
character and want to recreate it from scratch, you can suicide by pressing
'Q' (capital Q), followed by confirming the question if you really want to
suicide with 'y' and then finally verify your suicide with '@' key. Often
players are not happy with their character attributes, like Strength,
Intelligence, etc. and try several times until they get a luckier result. Note
that a suicided character is completely and permanently gone (as is a no-
ghost/hellish character on mundane death).
Also see (0.2) for some details about suiciding.



(3.3) Start-up equipment
------------------------
Every new player has some items right from the beginning, stored in the
inventory ("Recall" window). As a warrior you will have a Chain Mail and a
Sword.
Start-up equipment always has level 0 and cannot be used by other players!
You should now equip your start-up items, since they won't help you if
they stay inside the backpack. Press the key 'w', you will be asked which
item you would like to wear or wield, choose the letter in front of the item
inside your inventory, for example e) if the Sword is the fifth item in your
backpack. Equip both, sword and armor this way. You can also equip a
lightsource like a torch or lantern this way. If it is night in town that will
help you to see anything. Inside a dungeon you should always make sure that you
have a lightsource equippped.
The numbers '1' to '9' stand for different shops that you can enter to sell or
buy items. It is recommended that you sell your torches in store '1' (General
Store) and buy a lantern there instead, because a lantern provides more light,
increasing your radius of sight in the darkness. Also buy a flask of oil for
your lantern to refill it if it runs out of oil.
Press '?' to see an in-game introduction and overview of the keys and commands
that you may use. For example 'e' will show your currently equipped items.
You can chat with other players using the ':' key. This way you can also enter
certain commands like /fill to fill an empty bottle with water of a fountain.
At the beginning, all players receive a parchment with their start-up
equipment. It's the "Adventurer's guide to Middle Earth". Press '/' to read
it. It often contains some notes about the server, about player etiquette and
hints for newbies.



(3.4) Preparing the first time for fighting enemies
---------------------------------------------------
Before you enter a dungeon by stepping onto a staircase leading into the earth
(looks like this: '>') and pressing the staircase symbol '>' you will have to
buy some more items for the following reasons:
At the very beginning a single enemy who is a little bit stronger could kill
you easily without you having a fair chance to escape. At the same time,
slaying strong opponents at the very beginning will give very much experience,
thus making your character rise in experience levels and in power very
quickly!
Going deep down into the dungeon with a very low character level in hope of
meeting a monster that gives lots of experience while at the same time is not
too hard to kill is called "diving" and often is kind of suicide while
sometimes very rewarding.
However, buying certain items will greatly raise your chance of escaping from
dangerous situations alive or even slaying tough opponents. Also, by buying
an item (like magic potions or scrolls) your character will remember what it
'looks like' and instantly recognize it if you find some of the same type in
the dungeon. If you find a potion/scroll unknown to your character you will
have to either use it or sell it to a shop or use a scroll of identify to find
out what it is.
So to prepare for hunting in the dungeon, buy:
-Potion of Heroism
-Potion of Cure Light/Serious Wounds
-Scroll of Phase Door
The more you can buy of those the better. At least buy one potion of Heroism
and Cure Light Wounds.
And if you still have spare money (this one costs a lot) a
-Scroll of Word-Of-Recall



(3.5) Creating basic macros & inscribing items
----------------------------------------------
Macros are absolutely obligatory, you _will_ need them, so read this
carefully and if something isn't explained well, ask a fellow player
or send me a mail (mail@c-blue.de) :).
In turn-based single-player rogue-like games you always have enough time to
press "q" (quaff a potion) followed by the according inventory slot, for
example b) (if there is a potion of cure critical wounds in the second
inventory slot).
However, TomeNET is multiplayer and real-time. This means you don't have
enough time to look at your inventory and search the correct letters for items
which you might need *this instance* to avoid certain death. Often situations
get hectic, for example if all of a sudden a dark elven warlock comes around
the corner while you are engaging a pack of wolves, then you need kind of a
panic button that quickly transports you out of trouble.
To comply with this need, a macro system has been implemented, allowing you to
program freely choosable keys of your keyboard to perform a series of other
keypresses or commands when pressed. These macros can also interact with
certain items of your inventory by using "item inscriptions". You can inscribe
items (usually with the '{' key) as often as you like to, the inscription is
for example useful if an item has special abilities that you want to remember
by looking at it. You would for example inscribe an Elven Cord Armor that you
know helps you to resist the effects of poison. Then it might look like this
in your inventory:
Before: d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10}
After:  d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10} {resists poison!}
Inscriptions don't just help you to remember the abilities of certain items,
they can also interact with the macro system and other aspects of the game.
Usually if you want to quaff your potion of Heroism or read a scroll of Phase
Door, you would press qc (q for quaff, then c for third inventory slot for
example) or rd (r for read, then d for the fourth inventory slot, if your
scroll resides here).
However, if you just picked up another potion, your inventory order might be
changed and you had to remember the new positions of your vital potion and
scroll.
Now we are going to create three macros that will instantly quaff the potions
or read a scroll of recall, no matter where in the inventory they exactly are,
on a single keypress! Inscribe the potion of Heroism "@q1", the scroll of
Phase Door "@r1" and the potion of Cure Light Wounds "@q2".
It should look like this now:
b) a potion of Heroism {+,1} {@q1}
c) a potion of Cure Light Wounds {+,1} {@q2}
d) a scroll of Phase Door {+,1} {@r1}
Now we will create macros that make use of these items. Invoke the macro menu
by pressing '%' key. Then choose "(3) Enter a new action" and enter the two
characters and press Enter:
q1
Now choose "(5) Create a normal macro", then press the F1 key.
Now enter a new action, this time q2 instead of q1. Create another macro, this
time hit F2. Then Enter the third macro, r1, and choose F3 key.
Have your TomeNET client save the macros to a file on your hard disk, in your
TomeNET directory at \lib\user by choosing "(2) Dump macros" and entering a
filename, for example "warrior" or "firstmacros".
Now if you press F1 you will automatically quaff the potion of Heroism, F2 for
Cure Light Wounds and F3 to read the scroll. You are ready to enter the
dungeon now. If you still have some spare money, buy a flask of oil to fuel
your lantern if it runs out, as well as some rations of food in case you get
hungry.
The next time you log on, you may load your previously saved macro file by
invoking the macro menu again ('%'), choosing "(1) Load a user pref file" and
entering the filename.

Note that while it looks like overkill to create macro hotkeys for all lesser
items that aren't of importance during combat, inscribing them can still be
helpful, allowing to easily access them.
Example: You inscribed your flasks of oil @F1 . Now if your lantern is running
low on oil you just type the keys 'F' (to fill) and '1' instead of having to
search your inventory for the correct slot letter the oil flasks reside at.
Same goes for other items that aren't used in time-critical situations during
combat but nevertheless regularly, like scrolls of identify.

If two items have the same inscription, for example Potions of Cure Critical
Wounds @q1 and Potions of Healing @q1, the item which is above the others in
your inventory is chosen. So in this example you'd first use up all CCW
potions, then use the healing potions because CCW are located above healing
potions in your inventory. You can uninscribe items with the '}' key.

Loading macros automatically:
-----------------------------
If you save your macros to a filename that is the same as your character's
name and add a '.prf' at the end, it will be automatically loaded as you
join a game with your character, which is very helpful!
Example: If your character is named 'Kinkan', dump the macros to Kinkan.prf
to have them loaded automatically.
Note: If you're using a Linux version, remember that the file system is
case-sensitive, so don't save your macros to 'kinkan.prf' if your character
actually starts with a capital 'K' or the file won't be loaded. Make sure
the filename and character-, class- or race-name are exactly the same
('Dwarf.prf', 'High-Elf.prf', 'Ranger.prf'..).
Another option is to dump the macros to a file that is named like your account
it will be automatically loaded on all chars of that account.
You can also save macros to <racename>.prf or to <classname>.prf, like
Warrior.prf to have them being auto-loaded on all characters of that class.
Priority order (latter one overrides prior one):

pref.prf (global for all OS and users on the system)
user.prf (global, for the specific user)
pref-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)
graf-<operating system>.prf OR font-<operating system>.prf
                            (loaded if using graphics / ascii font on the
                             specified system)
user-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)
<race>.prf (for the specific race)
<class>.prf (for the specific class)
<account name>.prf (for the account the player logged in with)
<character name>.prf (for the specific character the player logged in with)

It is recommended to use only race/class/account/character preference files.

Command macros:  !WORKS DIFFERENT FROM MOST ROGUE-LIKES!
---------------
Command macros are only executed if the game isn't currently waiting for a
specific input, for example "quaff which potion?" or while you're typing chat
messages. That means they won't "disrupt" any other command which is currently
being run. This is convenient for keys which you use in chat, but can be
dangerous if you define vital macros as command macros.
It is recommended to make your most important macros normal macros or at least
hybrid macros (for example a "panic key" macro). Command macros don't work
in shops.

Hybrid macros:
--------------
Use 'create hybrid macro' instead of 'create normal macro' and 'create command
macro' in case you don't want the macro to appear on hitting the corresponding
key in a normal chat message (for example useful for '-' key so it won't
prevent you from inscribing your word-of-recall scrolls).
Hybrid macros still work within input requests such as "quaff which potion?",
just not in STRING INPUT such as chat lines, polymorph-codes or money amounts.
Hybrid macros don't work in shops.

Identity macros:
----------------
If you accidentally bound a macro to a key which wasn't free, for example
the key 'r' which is used to read a scroll, you can reset the key by
-pressing % to invoke the macro menu
-choosing '(6) - create an identity macro'
-pressing the key wich you want to reset.



(3.6) Creating macros for ranged attacks & abilities (spells)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Those macros basically consist of three parts.
1. Clearing the keyboard buffer (to avoid your character locking up in
   an attack queue if you hammer the trigger button for a ranged attack).
2. Designating a target.
3. Attacking the designated target.
How does the macro look like? (Note: Keys could vary depending on your
key set definitions. Throwing might be 't' instead of 'v' etc.)
For..
a) casting a magical spell
    Press 'm' to see your choices of casting magical spells. Let's assume you
    see this menu then:
        a) create ammo
        b) cast a spell
    Now we want 'b'. Press it to see a list of your magical books in your
    inventory. Let's assume you have learned spell 'a)' from book 'b)' in
    your inventory. Since the order of your books could change if you pick up
    new items or drop old ones, we will inscribe your magical book that is
    currently at position 'b)' like this:
    @m2
    The '2' is our own choice. We could've used 7 or 0 if we wanted to. Note
    that it must be a single digit! @m20 does not work.
    Now we can create the macro.
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -enter:    \e)mb2a*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    m       invoke the ability menu
                    b       choose 'b) cast a spell'
                    2       use the magical book which is inscribed @m2
                    a       use spell 'a)' from this book
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target for the
                            spell!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F1' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -To save your macros, press '2 - dump macros' and enter a filename of
     your choice. If you want your macros to be loaded automatically when you
     log in with your character, save them to '<yourname>.prf'. For example
     to 'Gandalf.prf' if your character is called 'Gandalf'.
     If your macros are not automatically loaded, you'll have to do it
     manually after logging in, by pressing % and choosing '1 - load a user
     pref file', then specifying the according filename.
    Note that if your character gains additional abilities that show up
    in the 'm' menu, it might happen that 'b) cast a spell' becomes
    'c) cast a spell' which would require you to redefine your macros.
    Fortunately there is a way around this, by using Ability Codes instead of
    letters to pick a skill to use. See 'Ability codes' below.
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player)
    Throwing would be done by pressing 'v', followed by the item and either
    one of the 8 directions or '*t' to designate the closest enemy as the
    target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume the item you want to throw is at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) 3 potions of blindness'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the potions @v1 and replace the c in the macro string by a 1.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the potions are currently 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)vc*t      or      \e)v1*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    v       throw an item
                    c   OR  1
                            choose 'c) 3 potions of blindness' OR
                            choose the item for throwing which is currently
                            inscribed @v1
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow)
    The keys we need are 'f' to fire and a direction key or *t to simply
    target the closest enemy.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -Since ammunition for firing or a boomerang is always at a fixed position
     in your equipment, we do not need any inscriptions on the weapon or
     ammunition - the game knows which item we want to use since there's only
     one possible choice.
     enter:    \e)f*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    f       fire an item (boomerang, if equipped) or
                            fire ammunition (if launcher & ammo is equipped)
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand
    Rods are used by 'z' (zap a rod) and wands by 'a' (aim a wand),
    followed by the item and either one of the 8 directions or '*t' to
    designate the closest enemy as target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume you want to aim the wand at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) a wand of magic missiles'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the wand @a0 and replace the c in the macro string by a 0.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the wand currently is at 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)ac*t      or      \e)a3*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    a       aim a wand (or 'z' to use a rod here)
                    c   OR  0
                            choose 'c) a wand of magic missiles' OR
                            choose the item which is currently
                            inscribed @a0   (or @z0 for a rod)
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.

What happens if you leave out the '\e)' part?
Well, that means the commands that aren't processed yet will stay in the
buffer and wait for execution. Example:
You hit the macro  f*t  30 times rapidly. Now your character will shoot 30
times with his bow. However, since he's quite slow, this might take him 30
seconds! You now sit in front of your keyboard and watch your character
process all the remaining 30 shots. If suddenly an enemy appears that needs
you to teleport away since it's too dangerous, you couldn't press any key
until the 30 shots are finished. The character is 'locked'.
The ')' in the macro '\e)f*t' clears all previous keypresses and hence
allows you to hammer the macro without fearing a lock.

(3.6a) Ability codes
--------------------
A problem with the 'm' key is that it not only brings up your magic spells
but a menu containing all skills you can use. Those can be arrow fletching
or dodging for example.
Now you would have to rewrite your macros each time you gain another ability.
Example:
You are an adventurer who can cast magic spells, so if you press 'm' you
are asked which spell you want to cast.
Now you train in archery, learning the ability to create ammunition from
junk items. If you press 'm' now, a menu will appear, asking you if you
want to create ammunition or cast a magic spell instead. So you of your
macros need to be rewritten to take account of this question.
To avoid this, you can directly choose which skill (ie spell-casting) you
want to use in your macros, by specifying the "ability code"!

Here is a list of all available ability codes:
9       Create ammunition (for archers)
3       Cast monster spell (for mimics)
8       Check your dodge chance
10      Set a monster trap
11      Cast a magic spell / recite a holy prayer

After the ability code has been entered you need to press Enter to confirm it.
In a macro, this is done by '\r' (one of the so-called escape sequences).
Example for a macro that directly specifies the ability code to cast the magic
spell "a) Manathrust" from book "a) Beginner Cantrips" on the closest monster:

\e)m@11\r2a*t

What does that mean?
\e  ->  escape any pending input request, if there is any
        (so we don't have to press ESC before casting the spell in case we're
         currently 'L'ooking around or something)
)   ->  clear the keyboard buffer (removes all pending keypresses that haven't
        been processed yet due to slow character speed, so we become instantly
        ready to perform our mana thrust spell _now_)
m   ->  invoke an ability
@   ->  specify an ability code directly
11  ->  the code for 'cast a magic spell/recite a holy prayer'
\r  ->  press Enter to confirm
2   ->  cast from book 2 (inscription on the book must be @m2)
a   ->  cast spell "a)" (Manathrust)
*t  ->  choose the closest monster as target

(That macro basically does the same as:
mb2a*t
..assumed that entry 'b)' in the ability menu (invoked by 'm') is
'b) Cast a spell'. Except for escaping and clearing the keyboard buffer.)



(3.7) Example macro sets
------------------------
(For the meaning of '\e)' see below (3.8). I recommend to have all your
macros start with the '\e)' sequence to avoid character lock-ups due to
queued keypresses that have to be processed.)


An example macro set for fighters or archers:
---------------------------------------------
This macro set is already in your /lib/user folder! If it's not there,
download the latest client from www.c-blue.de/rogue.
You can load this macro file by hitting % to invoke the macro menu,
then enter '1' to load a macro file, and specifying its filename,
which is: example_fighter.prf
If you plan on using it for a longer time, immediately save it again
with the filename being identical to your character name, example: Killer.prf
if your character is named 'Killer'.
(You can save macros by choosing '(2) Dump Macros' in the macro menu.
Note: The file example_fighter.prf is write-protected to avoid overwriting.)

Key         Purpose of the Macro                    The macro   Inscription
                                                    itself      on the item(s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F1  fire with ranged weapon at closest target       \e)f*t          -none-
    (you can inscribe your ammunition:  !=
    to pick it up automatically)
F2  quaff cure critical wound or healing potion     \e)q1           @q1
F3  quaff speed potion                              \e)q2           @q2

    (see 5.9) instead of normal food, to quickly
    boost their powers if needed.)

As you can see this fighter is supposed to be able to use quite some magic
for support in addition to fighting. Especially helpful are rods of perception
or of speed. Not all warriors are bright enough to use magic items easily, nor
are players always willing to spend many points on the 'Magic Device' skill.
If you dislike the use of magic your character would have to rely completely
on scrolls of teleportation instead. Just make sure you have confusion and
blindness resistance then! (Those two aren't needed to use a staff.)
If you play Thunderlord, kill Dragonriders because they tend to drop a large
amount of firestones. If a difficult combat starts, just eat several of them
to get a larger amount of extra powers.

The above macro set slightly changed to fit
additional needs of a low level istari or other casters:
--------------------------------------------------------
This macro set is already in your /lib/user folder! If it's not there,
download the latest client from www.c-blue.de/rogue.
You can load this macro file by hitting % to invoke the macro menu,
then enter '1' to load a macro file, and specifying its filename,
which is: example_caster.prf
If you plan on using it for a longer time, immediately save it again
with the filename being identical to your character name, example: Killer.prf
if your character is named 'Killer'.
(You can save macros by choosing '(2) Dump Macros' in the macro menu.)

    You might also use any other book that provides
    a ranged attack spell, like fire flash.)

0   Cast manathrust on closest target               \e)m@11\r1a*t   @m1
    (Inscribe book of beginner cantrips  @m1)

This low level istari might be armed with a sling to support his yet weak
magic, so the F1 macro makes sense. Assuming that he uses the numpad keys for
movement, the keys +, - and 0 were used to allow quick access to his basic
spells. - and 0 use his startup book 'Beginner Cantrips' while the macro on
the + key requires that he bought a spellbook of noxious cloud (or any other
attack spell, like fire flash) and inscribed it accordingly.
(All macros in example_caster.prf were defined as hybrid macros.)



(3.8) Macros with special keys
------------------------------
You can use so-called 'escapes', meaning a combination of '\' and a regular
key to emulate some special keys in your macros:
\\              the backslash itself. Prevents it from being interpreted as
                the beginning of an escape sequence.
\e              equals the 'ESC' key.
\s              equals the 'SPACE' key. You can also just type in regular
                spaces, which will be converted automatically.
\r or \n        RETURN/ENTER or LINEFEED. Makes no difference.
                Example:
                :hi!\r:hi!\n    makes your character say 'hi!' two times.
)               clears the keyboard buffer (all previous key presses that
                still have to be processed will be forgotten).
Example:
:Hi all!\r      This macro writes 'Hi all!' to everyone.
\e)f*t          This macro will press escape to leave any potential
                running input routine, clear the buffer, fire a shot at
                the closest enemy. You can hammer this macro madly while
                playing without fear of your client processing the key
                presses forever, locking you in a position till your last
                arrow has been shot, since each time you hit the macro,
                it will clear the keyboard buffer (')' symbol) from all
                previous entries.
                The 'running input routine' means:
                If you previously pressed 'q' to quaff a potion, the game
                will now ask you 'Which potion?' and wait for your input.
                If you now see an enemy approaching before you decide which
                potion to quaff, you would usually have to press ESC to leave
                the quaffing input and start firing arrows then. By
                integrating the ESC key into the macro ('\e') this step is
                done automatically.
*I recommend to have all macros start with the '\e)' sequence.*

Miscellanous escape sequences:
\x??            Convert the hex code into an ASCII character. For example
                \x41 (hex 41, dec 65) will become the 65th character of the
                ASCII charset which is a capital 'A'.
\^              The caret '^' or 'accent circonflex'.
\b              stands for the BACKSPACE key.
\t              stands for the TABulator key.
\0?? or \1?? or \2?? or \3??
                stands for an octal code. The code will be converted into an
                ASCII character similar to \x?? hex mode, so \101 becomes 'A'.
\w??            Waits (asynchronously) for ?? tenth seconds. (eg. 20 -> 2 s)
                Use this for macros which contain several commands in a row
                which depend on each others execution. You might have to
                adjust the delay to your personal latency, depending on your
                internet connection.

(3.8a) Creating a chat macro for your party
-------------------------------------------
Using public chat for party coordination can prove annoying to other players
and as well confusing to your fellow party members since it's sometimes hard
to read if people are chatting vividly.
On the other hand, entering your chat lines in this format
  <Party name>:<Text>
all the time can get annoying since you have to repeat the party name over and
over, although you can use just the first four letters or so as abbreviation.

There are two different ways to easily talk to your party.
1.) use the party wildcard '!'.
    Simply start your chatline like this !:blabla..., using the '!' in place
    of the party name. The text will be sent to your current party (if any).
2.) Create a macro to chat with a specific party, so you can write a
    party-message by hitting a single key, party-chatting becomes as easy as
    hitting ':' for normal chat.
    Enter the macro menu ('%'), enter a new action ('3'), enter the macro
    according to your party name. For example, if your party is called
    'Scarlet Knights', enter this string:
        :Scarlet:
    hit the Enter key to accept it, create a command macro ('4'), choose a
    key you wish to use for party chat from now on, and dump your macro ('2')
    to a file which is loaded automatically, like '<Your charname>.prf', for
    example Kinkan.prf.
    Using longer or shorter (at least 4 letters) strings works too of course,
    as long as there isn't a party of similar name which could get confused
    with yours.
Solution (1.) is much easier than (2.) of course, and the recommended way.



(3.9) Experience, level-ups and skill points
--------------------------------------------
By killing monsters your character gains experience. In general, harder
monsters on deeper dungeon levels give more experience than easy kills.
Hanging out on easy dungeon levels compared to your character level (for
example a high level 50 character on an (to him) easy dungeon level like 60)
may result in diminishing returns of experience points for killed monsters,
while monsters that dwell in deeper regions that are more fitted as a
challenge to the player, and whose levels are far above the player
character's level, will be very rewarding in terms of experience and loot.
Experience is shared automatically in 'parties', see (6.9).

Recommended minimum depths for optimal experience gain
Note: Always the deeper is the better! These are only _minimum_ recommended
depths. Also, your character might not always be strong enough to survive on
these depths. In that case better move to easier dungeon levels until you
found decent items and maxed out your vital stats.

        48                           81
        49                           92

        55                          110
        60                          120
        65                          130
        70                          140
        75                          150
        80                          160
        85                          170
        90                          180
        95                          190
        98                          196
        99                    no exp gained

If you are below the optimum depth, your experience gain will decrease.
The experience gained will be multiplied by 2 / (2 + leveldifference).
So for 1 level missing to optimum depth you would get 2 / (2 + 1) = 67% of
the optimum experience, at 2 levels difference you'd get 50%, 40% at 3, etc.
At level 64 and higher, no dungeon except for the Nether Realm (see (4.5))
will be deep enough to deliver optimal experience and your experience gain
will slowly start to decrease while you further rise in character levels.
The Nether Realm is by far the deepest dungeon in the game and allows players
of very high character levels to accumulate excellent experience.

If your character accumulates a certain amount of experience, (s)he will gain
a 'level-up', meaning that you become noticably more powerful than you were
until now.
Each character level requires your character to accumulate more experience
than was needed for the level before, up to millions of experience points!
All characters start the game at level 1. At level 50 they are supposed to
fight the bad boss of the game, Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness.

Each time your character gains a new level, (s)he also gains a few skill
points that you can distribute on your character's skills, press 'G' to invoke
the skill chart where you can raise skills of your choice. Do this at a safe
place, so your character won't be attacked and killed while you are looking
at the skill chart. The different skills are described in (6.2). Which
skills your character may specialize in depends on his class (profession),
and sometimes also on his race; skills that are not available to your
character's class are greyed out and cannot be raised.
On the skill chart you can press 'Up'/'Down' keys to select a skill and
'Right' key to invest one of your spare skill points into it. Choices cannot
be undone, so be careful here.
At each level-up you gain 5 skill points, so you will have gained at least 250
skill points at level 50. There is a slim chance that you get 6. This chance
can be raised by spending points into the 'Training' skill.
For details about skill point distribution and the different skills see (6.2).
Also see (7.5) for suggestions about skill point distribution.

Further, there is a slim chance that you gain an extra stat point on stats you
are very bad at ("stats" = "attributes" = STRength, INTelligence, WISdom,
DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma). This chance too is increased by the
'Training' skill.



(3.10) Death, ghosts and looting
--------------------------------
Normal/everlasting characters will turn into ghosts if they die. When you
become a ghost, your title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.
You can continue playing as a ghost, getting a slight experience penalty,
but that's not recommended. Instead, you should go for resurrection!

Ghosts can float up and down freely (just hit '<' or '>' key as if you take
a staircase), so they can quickly float out of the dungeon without having to
search for staircases. However, on some servers, a ghost cannot float down to
very deep dungeon levels which he hadn't visited yet when he was still alive.
So 'Ghost-Diving' (means: simply continuing playing as a ghost) is somewhat
limited there.

That will bring you back to life at the cost of experience (40% usually).
There are 3 ways to be revived:
-the ghost can visit a temple (green '4' in town). The temple priest will also
 give him some money. The temple priest will turn the ghost away without
 resurrecting it, if the town isn't the last one visited by the player when
 he was still alive. ('The temple priest turns you away')
-another living player reads a 'scroll of life' when standing directly next to
 a ghost.
-another living player speaks a prayer of 'resurrection' when standing
 directly next to a ghost. The higher the resurrection spell level was,
 the less experience will be lost.
The ghost will return to the world of living under the cost of a lot of
experience but at least the player can resume playing. If the ghost dies,
the character will finally be erased permanently, watch out!

Depending on the server configuration the number of times a ghost can be
resurrected can be limited (usually to 3 lifes, meaning 2 resurrections).
Unworldly/hellish characters don't have a ghost and are completely destroyed
if they die.
Ghosts slowly lose experience, if they go below 0 they will fade and the
player will be erased completely.

Ghosts have some special abilities, these are
-they can see invisible creatures
-life force can hardly be drained from them
-they cannot be paralyzed
-they spot warm-blooded creatures easily
-they resist darkness effects, poison, cold, blindness, fear and confusion
-they cannot be cut since they don't bleed
-they resist insanity attacks
-they can pass solid walls and mountains
-they can fly
-they cannot use items
-they cannot carry items except for the Book Of The Dead.

Ghosts can access undead powers with 'U' (currently not available, sorry).
Those powers drain your experience. If you use them too often and run out
of experience you will fade away (your character is erased then).

If a character dies totally (no ghost to be resurrected) the level will
(depending on the server configuration) stay static for a while to allow other
players to retrieve his loot. The deeper the dungeon level, the longer it will
stay static. It may take a whole day for very deep levels to 'unstatice'.

If a player dies, an automatic chardump is generated in /lib/user called
'<charname>-death.txt' (see 8.2).

Note that some or even all equipment and inventory might be lost forever if
you die in places which don't provide enough surrounding free room to drop
all of your items, for example a dense forest (green tree fields) or mountain
regions (brown ^ fields)!
Last but not least, non-validated players and characters below level 5 don't
drop their items on death, their loot will vanish forever.



(3.11)  Malicious effects players can suffer
--------------------------------------------
The player can suffer from various effects caused by monsters, traps or
himself. Against several of these effects the 'Savint Throw' ability helps
to decide whether it will be resisted or not (especially true for effects
that are cast by monsters on the player).
The various effects are:

For 'Fear', 'Blindness', 'Confusion' and 'Paralysis' - please see (5.6).

Hunger  -Gorged         Your speed gets reduced by 10.
        -Full           While being /afk in 'Full' state or in normal state
                        (normal = no food state is displayed, the 'Full'
                        disappeared), your digestion will be stopped, allowing
                        you to remain afk as long as you wish.
        -Hungry
        -Weak (yellow)
        -Weak (orange)
        -Weak (red)     You lose hit points and get paralyzed even with FA.
                        If you hit a bowel cramps trap, you instantly enter
                        this nutrition state. 'Slow Digestion' will help to
                        not get insta-paralyzed!

Slowdown        Monsters can cast spells or breathe (inertia) to slow down
                the player. This effect is temporary. 'Free Action' helps
                a bit to reduce the effect from inertia breath.

Stun    -Stun           Reduces your martial arts damage (because you cannot
                        perform MA special styles while stunned).
                        Also reduces to-hit and to-dam.
        -Heavy stun     Reduces your martial arts damage (because you cannot
                        perform MA special styles while stunned).
                        Also reduces to-hit and to-dam greatly.
        -Knocked out    You cannot perform any action while knocked out,
                        it leaves your character completely helpless.
                        Beware! High AC helps to prevent it, see (5.11).

Cut                     Cuts will make you lose HP continuously.
(Graze, Light cut, Bad cut, Nasty cut, Severe cut, Deep gash, Mortal wound)

Poison  -Poisoned       The player will continuously lose Hit Points.
                        Resisting poison will prevent the player from getting
                        poisoned (compare (5.6)).



(4) The world
=============
(4.1) Running, picking up items, fighting
-----------------------------------------
If no monsters are within your sight, you are able to run. This
feature was introduced to let you quickly cross empty areas, while it will
cease to work as long as you fight monsters. To run, press SHIFT+<direction>
or type '.' followed by a direction. Running using SHIFT+<direction> will
currently only work if NUMLOCK is turned off unfortunately.

If you want to pick up an item from the floor, step on that field and press
'g' (or press '5' on the numpad, while NUMLOCK must be on). For more
information about finding, identifying and selling items, see (5.7).
However, note that the keys can vary depending on your system configuration.

You attack a monster with your equipped melee weapon by simply moving on
the monster's field. Alternatively you can just stay still and let the
monster approach you, if you stand still and an enemy is on an adjacent
field (directly next to you, no space between you and the enemy) then your
character will automatically attack it with the equipped melee weapon.
This feature is called 'the auto-retaliator'. If you want to use ranged
attacks you have several choices.
a) casting a magical spell ('m')
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player) ('v')
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow) ('f')
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand ('z', 'a')
For all types of ranged attacks you'll need to designate a target. As soon as
you finish casting an attack spell or if you press 'f' to fire an arrow/bolt/
pebble/shot the game will ask you for a target or direction. You can now
either press one of the 8 direction keys to fire into that direction, or you
press the asterisk '*' followed by a 't' to designate the closest enemy as
your target, which usually is what you want.
To learn how to create a macro instead of typing all these letters every time
you want to launch a ranged attack, look at
'(3.6) Creating macros for ranged attacks'.



(4.2) Level and owner of items
------------------------------
If you press 'l' to look at an unknown item that lies on the floor, you'll
see something like this:

You see a Long Sword {?} (2d5)

The '{?}' indicates that this item has not yet been 'identified'.
That means we don't know yet if it has certain magic abilities or if it's
even cursed. We just know what we can see with our very eyes, that it is
undoubtful some Long Sword, and all Long Swords do a base damage of 2d5.
For more information about finding, identifying and selling items, see (5.7).
If you pick it up it will be displayed in your inventory like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,?} (2d5)

Note the additional '+' symbol. It means that you're now the 'owner' of that
item because you were the first one to pick it up.
Now you want to find out if the sword has any magic abilities. So you read
a Scroll Of Identify (or a Staff Of Perception for example). The sword now
looks like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

Now we know all about it. It's a magical Long Sword (magical because its
magical to-hit and to-dam boni are not 0,0 but 1,5. That means it's an
enchanted Long Sword that magically adds +1 to your hit chance and +5 to
the damage, doing (2d5)+5 damage per hit) that requires its wielder to be
at least level 6 in order to use it.

-Now if you're the owner of the sword then you are able to use it even if your
level is lower than 6 !

-If you give this sword to someone else who is level 4
that person won't be able to use it because he's not the owner.

-If you give the sword to someone who is level 6 or higher, he will become the
new owner! Now you're unable to use the sword if you're level 5 and he gives
it back to you.

-To the owner an item has the '+' sign displayed in its name. Every other
player who looks at the item sees the owner's name instead. Example:
If you drop the sword to the ground and 'l'ook at it, you'll still see this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

but if someone else looks at it, assuming your name is 'Mithrandir', that
person will instead read:

e) a Long Sword {Mithrandir,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

-Last but not least a nasty scenario:
Your character (named 'Mithrandir', level 20) dies and loses his Bluesteel
Blade {+,20}. Now you're a ghost and decide to ask a fellow player (named
'Mugash', level 30) if he can defeat the monsters that killed you and bring
your items to town.
He agrees, you float up to town (remember that ghosts can simply float up
and down anytime by pressing < and >) and revive in the temple (green '4').
If you revive, you'll always lose a bunch of experience. So your level is
now 18 instead of formerly 20.
The level 30 player kills all monsters and picks up your stuff. Since your
valuable Bluesteel Blade requires level 20 the level 30 player becomes its
new owner because he's not lower than 20. He arrives in town and drops the
sword for you.
You pick it up, and whooops it's a Bluesteel Blade {Mugash,20} and you're
level 18. You can't wield it anymore! So the right choice would've been to
ask Mugash if he can buy a Scroll Of Life and revive you in the dungeon
after he killed off all mobs, to avoid him touching your items and becoming
the owner.



(4.3) Dungeon and tower types, Ironman, Jail
--------------------------------------------
Look for the staircase ">", step on it and press the '>' key to enter the
dungeon. There is often a so-called newbie tower, which is represented by a
"<", meaning it goes upwards instead of downwards. Enter it by pressing the
'<' key. The newbie tower allows you to die without suffering consequences,
and is easier in general. An experience penalty might be applied for killing
monsters in the tower (usually 50%). You might ask other players in game
(use ':' to chat) where/if there is a newbie tower (also called 'Training
Tower'), or you might search for it yourself.

While inside a town, you get a good overview including the staircases upwards
and downwards by invoking the map by pressing SHIFT+'M' (capital M !).
If you leave a town and explore the wilderness, M will bring up a map showing
you towns and areas that you have explored so far.

After you entered the dungeon, make sure again that you have equipped a light
source! Note the bright dots around you, these are lightened fields within the
radius of your light source. To look at your current dungeon/tower level or
city, press 'L' and use direction keys to navigate on the map.
Also know that there are interesting dungeons found in the wilderness that are
not connected to a town at all!

When you enter the dungeon from within the starting town Bree, you will note
in the main window instead of "Bree" your actual depth is displayed, telling
you on which dungeon level you are. Each dungeon level is 50 feet deeper.
Monsters have approximately the same level than the dungeon level they appear
on. You should try to figure out how deep you can go without dying. The
dungeon depth I can recommend is between 1/3 (if you are _very_ weak) of your
own character level and 3/4 of your character level. You can also go deeper,
in case you want to try diving quickly. On 750 ft you can encounter hounds
(their symbol is a 'Z'). These don't have much Hit Points but give much
experience. They are a famous target for diver.
For a list of the dungeons see '(4.5) Towns'.

Dungeon types
-------------
There are different types of dungeons. The main five are:
-Normal dungeons. The main dungeons below the five cities Bree, Minas Anor,
 Gondolin, Lothlorien and Khazad-dum are such regular dungeons.
 Normal dungeons/towers are marked by a light grey < or > symbol.
-NO_RECALL. These dungeons don't allow you to use Word-of-Recall nor
 probability travel to change the level. The staircases are the only way.
 Sending items via telekinesis to a player who is currently in a no-recall
 dungeon/tower will only work if both players are on the same dungeon floor.
 Ghosts of dead players can still float up/down.
 No-recall dungeons/towers are marked by a light red < or > symbol.
-NO_RECALL_DOWN. You may not recall into this dungeon/tower. You can use
 recall to get out of it though. Probability travel works towards the surface
 but not the towards the dungeon bottom/tower top. To Telekinesis the same
 restrictions apply as for NO_RECALL. Ghosts may float freely.
 Staircases are yellow.
-NO_UP. These dungeons won't allow you to go upwards, similar to ironman,
 just without the penalty of permanent ghost-death. You are allowed to use
 Word-Of-Recall as well! Ghosts of dead players can float upwards.
 No-up dungeons/towers are marked by a red < or > symbol.
-FORCE_DOWN. Same as NO_UP, but you can only recall at the bottom of the
 dungeon, similar to ironman (except for the no-ghost death penalty).
 Force-down dungeons/towers are marked by an orange < or > symbol.
-Ironman. Ironman dungeons or towers won't allow you to recall or to use
 staircases that lead upwards! If you die in such a dungeon or tower you won't
 turn into a ghost either but get destroyed completely.
 Sending items via telekinesis to a player who is currently in an ironman
 dungeon/tower will only work if both players are on the same dungeon floor.
 To leave an ironman dungeon/tower you'll have to get to it's bottom
 respectively top.
 Ironman dungeons/towers are marked by a dark grey < or > symbol.
-Hellish. Players suffer no-ghost deaths inside hellish dungeons.
 Even if they're everlasting.
 Hellish dungeons/towers are marked by a fire-like flickering < or > symbol
 (red/yellow).
-NO_DEATH. The Training Tower in Bree has this flag. Players who die inside a
 no-death dungeon won't turn into a ghost if they 'die' but just be teleported
 back to town! They still lose experience though.
 No-death dungeons/towers are marked by a green < or > symbol.
If a dungeon has several of these flags, the latter ones will override the
staircase colour. So a hellish ironman dungeon has hellish-looking staircases.

Jail:
Note that jails (if the server has one) don't allow any type of teleportation,
nor will you turn into a ghost if you get killed there, instead you will get
destroyed completely. Same as with 'ironman dungeons'.
A jail usually has an ironman tower inside.

Sometimes you might find ruins of old staircases that don't lead to any
dungeon or tower. Those have no further functionality and are coloured grey.

(4.4) Terrain
-------------

Terrain features in the main window:
------------------------------------
Town buildings-
Consisting of red '#' (roof) and white '#' (wall), these cannot be damaged or
destroyed.

Floor-
Dots '.' rensemble empty floor. Green dots are grass, brown ones dirt, grey
ones stone or ash.
Red dots are lava, violet dots nether mist. These can be dangerous to cross!

Trees-
Thick trees are rensembled by green or grey (dead) '#'. To pass them you need
to either fly over them or to be an Ent, shepherd of trees to whom they will
slightly bow aside to make room. Trees can also be burned up.

Staircases-
'<' and '>' are staircases leading upwards or downwards into towers or
dungeons. (Press the according key to walk the staircase.)

Doors-
Light brown '+' are closed doors, ' are open or broken doors.
(Use 'o' to open, 'c' to close and 'B'/'F' to bash/force doors.)

Void Jumpgates-
Violet '+' are void jumpgates that teleport you elsewhere.
Press '>' key to use them.

Stores-
Store entrances are represented by coloured numbers '0'..'9'.
See (4.5) for details about stores.

Rubble-
':' is rubble. Characters with high enough archery skill can stand next to
rubble and use their 'create ammo' ability to create ammunition from it.

Pits-
Dark '#' are pits that can only be crossed if you have levitation or flying
ability. Bree is protected by pits around the outer tree wall. These pits
cannot be disarmed or destroyed.

Walls-
White '#' are permanent walls which cannot be damaged or destroyed.
'#' and '%' of different grey tones are granite walls, magma intrusions,
quartz veins and can be tunneled into and take damage from earthquakes.
Yellow '#' are sand walls, white '#' are ice walls.

Water-
On the world surface but also in some dungeons there's lots of water (blue '~'
fields). It can be dangerous to cross it if you're not good at swimming or if
you cannot fly :) Further, nasty creatures are said to live in the seas. Ents
cannot drown in water since they completely consist of wood.

Mountain chains-
Brown '^' fields are massive and very high mountains. To travel these you need
a climbing set or another item that gives you climbing abilities. Dwarves can
intrinsically travel through mountains. In dungeons '^' rensemble solid
structures of massive rock that reach nearly up to the top of the huge dungeon
levels, climbing these is as hard as climbing mountains above ground.
White '^' are extremely high mountain chains.

Lava-
Red dots '.' are lava, which will do heat damage to your character in
regular intervals. This might also destroy items in your inventory in case
you're not immune to fire.

Fountains-
'_' are fountains. To drink from them use /sip command or press the '_' key.
See (0.2) for more details.


Terrain features on the world map:
----------------------------------
Lakes-          are displayed as blue '~' fields on the world map.
Grassland-      green '.'
Forest-         green '*'
Swamps-         violet '%'
Dense forests-  dark grey '*'
Wasteland-      umber (bronze) '.'
Towns-          yellow 'T'
Mountains-      dark grey '^'
Volcanos-       red '^' - careful, you may get stuck in this terrain!
Rivers-         light blue '~'
Coast areas-    yellow ','
Oceans-         blue '%' fields.



(4.5) Towns, shops, the dungeons
--------------------------------
If you create a new character, it will start in 'Bree', a town located at
position 32,32 on the world map (same position on all servers!).
The world map however, ranging from 0,0 (bottom left corner) to 63,63
(top right corner), bears several other towns that you can find and
explore. These towns often contain different shops (some are said to offer
*Identify* service or even a cure to Black Breath) and harder dungeons.
However, they might also be a very dangerous place to stay, compared to Bree.
In general you can say the harder the local dungeon entrance of a town the
more dangerous monsters can spawn within the town! Bree is the only town that
contains just more or less harmless townsfolk.
The worst are Khazad-dum and Lothlorien, if you go here be _very_ cautious.
Monsters that appear here might look like harmless novice paladins or snagas
but are in fact of a higher level and more powerful.
On servers that run an older version of TomeNET those monsters will be +50
levels higher(!), that means they move extremely fast, take LOTS of damage,
and can kill you easily.
However, it has been observed that people who figured out how to climb high
mountains travelled to Khazad-dum despite their low level for a strange
reason >:-) .
Even if you decide to stay in Gondolin, which is relatively harmless,
don't go afk for a longer time or even a snaga archer might kill you with his
ranged attacks. Always a nasty surprise..

Here is a list of towns and their corresponding local dungeons:

Town        |Depth/Level|   Local dungeons    | Depth/Level      |Required
            |of the town|                     | of the local     |player level
            |itself     |                     | dungeon          |for entering
------------+-----------+---------------------+------------------+------------
Bree        |   0 ft/  0|The Training Tower   | +50..+400/ 1..10 |    1
            |           |Barrow-Downs         |  50..1750/ 1..35 |    1
Gondolin    |1000 ft/ 20|Mordor               |1700..3300/34..66 |   15
Minas Anor  |2000 ft/ 40|The Paths of the Dead|2000..3500/40..70 |   20
Lothlorien  |3000 ft/ 60|Angband              |3350..6350/67..127|   30
Khazad-dum  |4000 ft/ 80|Angband              |3350..6350/67..127|   30

To enter a dungeon your character must have the displayed minimum level.
Otherwise you'll get a message like this "Suddenly you're grasped by an
uncontrollable fear".

The deeper you decend into the dungeons, the more the passing of time itself
will be slowed down to make it easier to fight very fast monsters. By the time
your character enters those depths, it should already have boosted speed so
the slowdown won't bother you but come in handy. For example if you enter
Mordor you will notice a slowdown to to approx. 1/2 standard time.

Also, there are several dungeons that aren't bound to a town. Here's a list:
Dungeon                         |   Depth/Level         | Min. required player
                                |                       |   level to enter

The Illusory Castle             | 1750..2650/ 35..52    |       10
The Sacred Land Of Mountains    | 2000..2250/ 40..45    |       20
Erebor                          | 2500..3150/ 50..61    |       35

Mount Doom                      | 4250..5000/ 85..100   |       38
Nether Realm                    | 8300..9850/166..196   |       40 (*)

The Europe server usually has one or several 'ironman' dungeons (see (4.8)),
their entrances (stairs) waiting to be discovered by some bold explorers.
Such custom dungeons appear as 'wilderness' in the "Recall depths and Towns"
list, the minimum required character level to enter is usually 0.

(*) To enter the Nether Realm a player must carry the 'King'/'Queen' title,
acquired by beating Morgoth, The Lord of Darkness.
Each floor in the Nether Realm gives a +2% bonus to experience from monster
kills.
The amount of experience is already very high even without the depth-bonus,
since creatures in the Nether Realm are of a very high level.


Shops:
------
Each town has several shops, displayed as numbers 1..9 and some '+'.
The 1..9 are standard shops, namely..
1       General Store   Sells food, lanterns, ammunition, cloaks and shrooms.
2       Armoury         Offers various basic armour. Rarely excellent pieces.
3       Weapon Shop     Offers various basic weapons. Rarely excellent pieces.
4       Temple          Player ghosts will be revived here, and receive some
                        money. The temple sells weapons for priests, scrolls
                        and potions.
5       Alchemist       Sells various scrolls and potions.
6       Magic Shop      Sells wands, staves, rings and amulets.
7       Black Market    Sells many different items, mostly very good ones.
                        This shop is very expensive and buys for very little
                        in return. Better not sell your items to this shop,
                        as long as a regular store will pay you better.
                        Some items cannot be sold elsewhere though.
8       The Inn         In Bree it's The Prancing Pony. Inside the inn,
                        players are relatively safe from monsters.
9       Bookstore       Sells books for istari, priests and all other (hybrid)
                        magic users.
+       These are different everywhere. Some examples are..
        The Bank        Several towns have a bank where you can deposit and
                        withdraw money, so you won't lose it accidentally on a
                        dungeon trip.
        Casino.         Minas Anor has a casino.
        ID service      Will identify all items you currently carry for a fee.
        *ID* Service    Will *identify* an item for a fee.
                        See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID*, shops!
        Herbal Healing  Will cure black breath for a high fee. (See 1.5 for
                        more information about Black Breath.)
        Enchant Services
                        These will enchant weapons, arrows, or all armour
                        parts you currently have equipped.

Shops that buy and sell items will have a price limit that they will pay for
an item a players wants to sell. The limit varies from 50,000 to 300,000 Au
depending on the shop owner. The shop owners change regularly, if a shop makes
you a bad offer (the cap price) just wait for the owner to change or visit a
different shop. Shops in different towns are run by different owners although
they may use the same number '0'..'9' for their entrance symbol.
If the item is worth more than 300,000 Au maybe you can find a fellow player
who is wealthy and in urgent need of your items.
See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID* and shops!



(4.6) Pits and vaults
---------------------
Usually monsters are found on their corresponding depth. You can browse the
file r_info in lib\game inside your TomeNET directory to find out which
monster occurs where. However there are some exceptions, where you can find
monsters out-of-depth, meaning that you will encounter way more powerful
enemies. That can be very dangerous but also very rewarding. Out-of-depth
monsters usually occur inside of so-called "pits" and "vaults". Pits are large
rooms, surrounded by a rectangle-shaped passage, sometimes with special
structure inside. Vaults are extremely large structures of rooms and passages,
very often surrounded by permanent walls that cannot be damaged.
A vault can be a real adventure of its own! If your character isn't very
powerful compared to the dungeon level, you better stay out of vaults if their
structure doesn't allow easy monster killing.



(4.7) Traps & Trap sets
-----------------------
About traps:

At the beginning you will encounter traps that can do little damage, some will
decrease your stats temporarily, they are annoying but not a big danger.
However, later on traps will become extremely nasty and you should either get
a very high searching skill or make sure that you have staves, spells or
scrolls that can detect traps. If you encounter a dangerous trap do not try to
disarm it if you are not very sure that you can do it without setting it off.
Fighting traps will become an essential part of the gameplay later on. Vaults
will have *lots* of traps and if you haven't got superior disarming skills (or
wands of disarming / trap destruction) every single move of your character has
to be planned then! This can be especially annoying and dangerous if there are
multiplying or extremely tough monsters inside the vault. If your searching
ability is 'Heroic' or 'Legendary' you will discover most traps instantly just
by coming close to them without having to explicitely search for them.
If you look at an object that is on an already detected trap, you will be
notified about the trap by an ^ symbol in front of the item name and the trap
type appended to it in { } brackets. It looks like this:
^ A potion of Constitution {Chaos Ball Trap}


About trap sets (or trapkits):
The 'Trapping' skill allows a player to set up 'monster traps'.

A monster trap consists of
-a trap set
-an item (or a stack of items) to load the trap set.

Each kind of trap set requires different items serving as ammunition:
Catapult Trap Set       -       Sling ammo (fires with 2x base might).
Arrow Trap Set          -       Arrows (fires with 3x base might).
Bolt Trap Set           -       Bolts (fires with 4x base might).
Fumes Trap Set          -       Potions. The effects are very similar to the
                                effects when throwing a potion at a monster,
                                the trap will greatly increase the potion's
                                effectiveness though, by generating a thick
                                fume that envelops nearby creatues and
                                possibly gets inhaled as well.
Magic Trap Set          -       Scrolls. Even scrolls that are usually only
                                used on items might have effects on certain
                                creatures.
Device Trap Set         -       Wands/Staves/Rods.
                                The charges of wands and staves will be
                                decreased by 1 each time the trap sets off.
                                Rod-traps will have timeouts, same as the rod
                                itself.

A normal trap set can be loaded with 1 item of the according ammo.
After it went off (and is out of charges for device traps) you can pick up the
trap set to use it again.
If it was a catapult/arrow/bolt trap set you can often recover the ammunition
too, in case it didn't break. (Magic arrows and artifact ammo never break).

Trap sets can have special (ego) powers:
(prefixes:)
Automatic       - Can set off up to 99 times, with a 20% chance each time of
                  ceasing to function. Requires the according amount of ammo
                  though, if it's not a device trap set.
Fully Automatic - Sets off up to 99 times.
                  Requires the according amount of ammunition if it's not a
                  device trap set.
Well-hidden     - Makes it harder for monsters to spot the trap.
Complicated     - Trap gets an extra AC bonus, making it harder to disarm.
Obvious         - Curses the trap and makes it practically useless.
(suffixes:)
of Extra Might  - fires with +x (bonus shown in round brackets) extra might.
of Extra Shots  - fires +x (bonus shown in round brackets) extra shots/round.
for Dragons     - Only triggers against dragons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Demons      - Only triggers against demons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Animals     - Only triggers against animals. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Undead      - Only triggers against dragons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots. Especially deadly against ghosts.
for Evil        - Only triggers against dragons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots. Especially deadly against ghosts.

If monsters notice a trap they can try to disarm it. Armour class of a trap
makes it harder for monsters to disarm the trap. Trap sets and ammo that were
disarmed by a monster cannot be recovered.

You can disarm your own traps to get back the trap set (and ammunition).



(4.8) Level & vault feelings, Jail, Ironman
-------------------------------------------
Levels:
Sometimes if you enter a new dungeon level your character will have a special
feeling about it, displayed in orange text.
The feelings are as follows:
"You feel an imminent danger!" ->   This dungeon level is *way* higher than
                                    your character level.
"You feel a suppressive air..." ->  You cannot use wraith form or probability
                                    travel on this level.
                                    (NO_MAGIC, +15% experience bonus!)
"You have a feeling of peace..." -> You cannot use genocide on this level!
                                    (NO_GENO, +5% experience bonus!)
"You lose all sense of direction..." -> You won't be able to auto-map this
                                        dungeon, meaning that you won't
                                        remember the dungeon layout.
                                        You can only see your nearby
                                        surroundings within your character's
                                        line of sight.
                                        (NOMAP, +15% experience bonus!)
"You feel like a stranger..." ->    You cannot use magic mapping nor
                                    clairvoyance here!
                                    (NO_MAGIC_MAP, +5% experience bonus!)
"The walls here seem very solid." ->    You cannot destroy the dungeon
                                        structure on this level.
                                        (NO_DESTROY, +5% experience bonus!)
"You feel that your life hangs in the balance!" ->      ** Extremely dangerous
                                        to normal/everlasting players! **
                                        This only occurs on a level where
                                        Morgoth, The Lord Of Darkness resides,
                                        grasping the area with his untamable
                                        will to destroy.
                                        Players who die on this level will be
                                        completely extinguished and not even
                                        their ghost will survive! Everlasting,
                                        normal and hard-mode players will die
                                        the same way as unworldly and hellish
                                        ones!

Vaults:
Vaults can also bear a very dangerous feature that is displayed as dark grey
feeling as soon as you are about to enter the vault:
"The air in here feels very still." ->  Means that you cannot use any type of
                                        teleportation, including word-of-
                                        recall while inside the vault. Beware!
                                        Further, Wraith Form and probability
                                        travel won't work either!
As soon as you leave such a no-teleport-vault you'll receive this feeling:
"Fresh air greets you as you leave the vault."



(4.9) Navigating on maps
------------------------
The world map is divided into 64 x 64 world map sectors. Each of these sectors
has a size of 5 x 5 smaller sectors (screens). Dungeon levels or tower floors
also have a size of 5 x 5 sectors, same as 1 world map sector. Monsters cannot
cross world map sector borders! Keep this in mind while travelling.

You can scroll around the level within the main window by pressing 'L'. This
allows you to look at all 4 x 4 sectors of your current level. Note that
dungeon/tower levels are often smaller, sometimes even just 1 x 1. While you
are looking around, the current map sector is displayed in the top left corner
of the screen. This information can help other players to find you in case you
need help.

You can press 'M' to invoke a map that gives you a larger overview.
If you press 'M' in a dungeon, tower or a town, you'll see the complete 4 x 4
sectors. If you invoke the map while you're in the wilderness outside of towns,
you will see a part of the 64 x 64 world map, centered around your current
world map sector, displaying towns (yellow T), the sea (blue %), mountains (^)
and other information.

In the main window right below your 'Cur SP' you will see two numbers
separated by a komma, these tell you your current world map sector.
In case you're currently in a town, the town's name will be displayed in the
bottom right corner of the screen.

If you're in a dungeon or tower, you will see your current depth/height in
feet. Each dungeon level or tower floor has a height of 50 feet.
Example: If it shows '-550ft' that means you've descended to the 11th level
of the dungeon. The deeper you go, the more nasty monsters will show up.
Negative depths in dungeons and positive heights in towers mean identical
monster difficulties. Example: In Bree there's a tower and a dungeon. In the
2nd tower floor on 100ft you will usually find the same monsters as in the
dungeon on level -100ft (2nd dungeon level).



(4.10) Houses
-------------
Press 'h' to buy or sell a house, or to change house parameters (for example
giving all your party members access to it). You need to stand directly next
to the house door to do this.
The house doors can have different colours to you: 
-a green house door indicates that you have access to it,
-a brown house door indicates that the house is currently unowned
 (so you may buy it)
-a grey door indicates that this house is owned by someone and you don't have
 access to it.
If you forgot which houses you own, type ~6 to see a list of your houses.

Items on the floor within a house don't form piles! If you drop too many
items and space in the house runs out the dropped item may just disappear!

Party/Guild access are currently disabled due to abuse, sorry :|.



(5) Item details
================
(5.1) Melee weapons, brands
---------------------------
One of TomeNET's features is the "auto-retaliator". This means, if an enemy
enters a field that is adjacent to you, you will automatically attack the foe
with your equipped melee weapon. This is helpful against lags as well as for
preventing RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury ;).

Melee weapons have at least three stats, it's 'damage dice', 'to-hit' and
'to-damage'. 'To-hit' helps you actually not miss an enemy, 'to-dam' increases
the damage. The 'damage dice' shows how many dice are added to calculate the
random damage you inflict on an enemy as you hit!

Example:  Broad Sword (2d5) (+3,+4)
This means, your chance to hit is a bit increased (+3) and you will inflict
a damage of: 2 dice with 5 sides each, to the result +4 is added.
So the damage you inflict will randomly vary from 6 (1+1+4) up to 14 (5+5+4)
meaning that you do an average damage of 10 per hit with that weapon
([6+14]/2 = 10).

A very important thing about melee weapons is that, depending on your strength
and dexterity as well as the weight of your melee weapon, you might be able to
deliver more than just one blow per round with it!
For example a warrior might be able to swing his "Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+0)"
one time per round, delivering 2*(1..5) damage. The 'd' means dice, so it's
like throwing 2 dice with 5 sides each and adding their values to estimate the
damage you inflicted on the victim. Now if that warrior equips a light whip
which weighs only 3 pounds (the broad sword weighs 15 pounds) he might get 2
or even 3 swings per round! Since a whip does 1d6 damage, he would deal
(assumed he got 2 hits) 2* 1*(1..6) damage, which in total is more damage per
round than he would deliver using the broad sword! Let's compare what happens
if the warrior magically enchants the damage of both weapons, using "Scrolls
of Enchant Weapon To-Dam" (these scrolls can be bought in shop '5').
One of these scrolls can enchant a weapon so one extra point is added to the
damage dice after they have been added. If we manage to enchant the damage of
the broad sword 9 times, the weapon will look like this:
"Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+9)"
That means after 2 dice with 5 sides each have been added, there will be
further 9 points of damage added to the result!

Broad Sword 2d5 (+0,+9) 1 blow per round  -->  1* [ 2*(1..5) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2*((1+5)/2) + 9 average damage which is 15 per round.

Whip 1d6 (+0,+9) 2 blows per round  -->  2* [ 1*(1..6) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2* [ 1*(3,5) +9 ]  -->  2*12,5 = 25 damage per round!
       Far more than with the broad sword.

As you can see, the additional damage caused by enchantment will
be added to the dice result.

If you manage to get your hands on an item that imbues your melee weapon with
an elemental brand (like a Ring Of Ice for example), the dice of your weapon
will be multiplied by 3 if the target doesn't resist that brand.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.

Characters using weapons have a limited number of melee attacks per round,
depending on the character class (profession). A table showing the blow/round
limits is at section (6.5).

While smaller melee weapons require only 1 hand to use them, some larger
weapons need 2 hands. Using a shield together with those is not possible.
Some weapons _can_ be used two-handed. That means you will receive penalties
to to-hit and to-dam bonus if you use it one-handed. Look at your character
screen ('C') to compare the to-hit/to-dam boni and see if it's worth it.



(5.2) Ranged Weapons, brands
----------------------------
Ranged weapons are not to underestimate, they can be very powerful. Especially
characters with low Hit Points will love them since approaching hordes can be
killed at a distance or at least driven back, so they won't come close and hit
the player with devastating blows. It is recommended that you equip a ranged
weapon as soon as possible, and enchant its 'to-damage' to at least +7 !

Ranged weapons have to-hit and to-dam like melee weapons, but instead of
dice they have a 'multiplier'.

Example:  Ranged weapon is:  Long Bow (x3) (+0,+5)
          Ammunition is:     65 Arrows (1d4) (+0,+2)
If you shoot an arrow, it will inflict
( 1d4 +2 +5 ) * 3 damage on the victim. The dice of the arrow varies from 1
up to 4, so we can do a damage of 24 up to 33, so the average damage is 28,5.
We can see here that ranged weapons can do a lot of damage :)

Ranged weapons will be placed in equipment slot 'b)'. After you equipped one,
you need to also equip ammunition that will be used. For example if you use a
long bow, you need to fill your quiver with some arrows. (w)ield the arrows,
and they will be placed into equipment slot 'm)', the ammo slot.
A macro that shoots at the target closest to you, looks like this:  f*t
Explanation in case you really want to know: f means fire, * means entering
targetting mode and choosing nearest target, t means exiting target mode and
remember currently selected target.
To automatically pick up your arrows simply inscribe them:  !=
Ranged weapons can also auto-retaliate, that means you will fire automatically
at targets on sight. To make your ranged weapon behave like that, inscribe the
_ammunition_ (not the bow):  @O  (the letter 'O').
However, auto-retaliating with a ranged weapon works only if the enemy stands
on an adjacent field, so it's pretty useless :)

The dice of ammunition are also effected by brands and slays same as normal 
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 2/5.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 2x your melee base damage.
For ranged weapons it will add 2*2/5x of your base damage, so multiply your
base damage by 1.8 instead of by 3 to get your total damage output.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.



(5.3) Martial Arts, brands
--------------------------
The "auto-retaliator" (see 5.1) also works if you fight bare-handed.

Training Martial Arts will give you..
-a bonus to-hit and to-dam.
-special combat techniques which your character will use automatically.
 These techniques do a lot of extra damage and often additionally stun or slow
 your opponent.
-special abilities and resistances (like Free Action, see (6.2) for details).
-extra speed and stealth bonus.
-extra AC bonus for each part of armour that is NOT worn.
 Increasing your martial arts skill lets you wear light and even medium armour
 and still benefit from its AC.
-a chance to grab your enemies to prevent them from casting or teleporting.
 (This chance adds to your interception skill.)

However, to use the full potential of martial arts you will need to take care
of several points..
-a light backpack makes a martial artist move faster and stealthier.
-a very heavy backpack (inventory) will nullify the abilities and resistances,
 as well as the speed and stealth bonus! You will see a red warning message,
 telling you that your backpack isn't comfortable to wear anymore.
-using too heavy armour will cut your number of blows per round to half, and
 nullify your to-hit, to-dam, speed and stealth bonus from MA.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or carrying a very heavy backpack will nullify
 the AC bonus from martial arts, and greatly reduce your number of blows per
 round.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or a shield will nullify the special combat
 styles, reducing your damage.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or a shield or wearing too heavy armour will
 reduce your grab chance to zero.
-using a heavy shield, melee or ranged weapon will nullify your speed and
 stealth bonus.

The armour weight limit is 10.0 lb + Martial Arts skill level * 0.4 lb.
So for MA 50 it is 10.0 + 20.0 = 30.0 lb.
You will receive a warning message if your armour gets too heavy.

Here's a table, for those who prefer this view:

Equipment/inventory  | +hit/dam  abilities  styles  spd/stl  +AC  grab  blows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Light backpack       |                                 +
Heavy backpack       |               0                 0      0           0
Heavy armour         |     0                           0           0     50%
Any melee weapon     |                        0               0    0      0
Any ranged weapon    |                        0               0    0      0
Heavy shield/weapons |                        0        0           0

Martial Arts special combat techniques have certain dice, similar to normal
weapons. These dice are also effected by brands and slays same as normal 
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 1/3.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 2x your base damage.
For MA it will add 2/3x of your base damage, so multiply your base damage
by 1.67 instead of by 3 to get your total damage output.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.

You cannot use special techniques while stunned or confused.

Here is a list of Martial Arts special techniques:
A technique is picked randomly, then used if random(1..MA_Skill)>chance.
If the chance fails, another technique is picked.
There are MA_Skill / 7 tries to find a technique, otherwise you will hit
without a special technique. There is always at least 1 try to pick a
technique.

Depending on your MA skill, you have a fixed number of barehanded attacks
per round, independent of your character class, your strength or your
dexterity (unlike characters that use weapons):
(The attack number can be increased further by items like rings of extra
attacks or by magical influence like priest prayer 'Zeal'.)
Note that EA effects (like EA ring or Zeal prayer) won't work on characters
who fight barehanded without having Martial Arts skill at 01.000 or higher!

Martial Arts skill level        Attacks per round

            50                          8



(5.4) Slaying vs brands
-----------------------
If you use a weapon that slays trolls, that means its dice will be tripled if
you hit a troll ('T'). If you have an item that gives fire brand, the dice
would also be tripled by the brand. Slaying and brands are not cumulative.
That means you will get a total dice multiplier of 3 here.
Brands don't stack. The best one is taken. So if you wear a ring of fire and
your weapon does cold damage the dice will be multiplied by 3 if the target
doesn't resist both heat and cold. If the target is susceptible to one of
those the dice are multiplied by 6. Same goes for SLAY flags.

If several multipliers match the highest one will be used.



(5.5) Weight of weapons and armour
----------------------------------
If your melee weapon or ranged weapon is too heavy you will hardly be able
to use it, resulting in reduced attack number per round and less damage.
You will get the message "You have trouble wielding such a heavy weapon/bow"
and probably your blows will drop to 1 and tohit/todam go near to zero.
A weapon is too heavy for you if its weight is greater than the so-called
str_hold value. Below is a table with the str_hold values, depending on a
character's strength:

        str_hold    STRength of             str_hold    STRength of
                    the character                       the character

        24          15                      90          18/160-18/169

Wearing armour which is too bulky gives you this message:
"The weight of your armour encumbers your movement."
That means your mana will be (severely) reduced. To counter this effect,
train your 'Combat' skill.
In general, you can wear 20.0 lbs of armoury plus your combat skill (in lbs).
So 50 points in 'Combat' would allow you to wear 20.0 + 50.0 = 70.0 lbs of
armour parts without being encumbered.

Very heavy armour and/or heavy items in your inventory may also slow you down
(reduce your moving speed) if your STRength isn't very great.

Armour weight also affects Martial Arts, see (5.3) for more information if
you are a Martial Artist.



(5.6) Resistances & caps, Immunities, Susceptibilities
------------------------------------------------------

Resistances & caps
------------------
Several monsters or traps can cause elemental attacks on you. These attacks
can deliver very high damage if you do not 'resist' the specific attack type.
Those 'resistances' become very important in deeper dungeons where many
monsters are able to breathe on you with devastating power.

Permanent resistances (for example if you wear a ring and an armor that both
give fire resistance) will not stack. So one item is suffient for each
resistance. There is no difference if it's a helmet or an armour.
However, a temporary resistance (by potion or spell) and a permanent
resistance can stack. That means if you quaff a 'potion of resist heat'
(temporary resistance) and wear an armour of fire resistance (permanent
resistance) fire attacks will do only 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 of the original damage.
For more information on resistance/ability stacking see (5.17).

For all attacks the following way of how the final damage is calculated
applies:
If a monster breathes, that attack often has a damage potential of 1/3 of
the monster's hit points.
This 'raw' damage will now be capped at a maximum value that varies for the
different types of attacks.
If you 'resist' that attack, the damage will be cut to further 1/3 (this
value varies for the different types of attacks).

Example:
An Ancient Red Dragon breathes fire.
He has 1500 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 500 damage.
The damage cap for fire attacks is 1200. So the value of 500 remains.
Let's assume that your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down
to 1/3 now, leaving 170 damage.
Example 2:
A Great Hell Wyrm :) breathes fire.
He has 5000 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 1700 damage.
Since 1700 is greater than the cap (1200) it becomes 1200.
Let's assume your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down to 1/3,
leaving approx. 400 damage.


Overview:
Breath damage is capped, the number is given in the corresponding description.
Bolts and balls are not capped (except for the general damage cap of 1600).
Their damage maximum depends on the level of the casting monster as the
formulas show. The total maximum damage an attack can do in TomeNET is 1600
(general damage cap for all breath/bolt/ball attacks).

There are four so-called 'basic resistances'. These are
Fire/Heat               These attacks can burn items in your inventory.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Fire immunity allows you to travel over lava without
                        you or your inventory getting harmed.
                        Fire bolts do (level/3)+(9d8) damage.
                        Fire balls do (level*7/2)+10 damage.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory and equipment from getting harmed (5.10).
Frost/Cold              These attacks can shatter potions.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Frost bolts do (level/3)+(6d8) damage.
                        Cold balls do (level*2)+10 damage.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory and equipment from getting harmed (5.10).
Lightning/Electricity   These attacks can destroy rings and amulets.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your dexterity.
                        Lightning bolts do (level/3)+(4d8) damage.
                        Lightning balls do (level*3/2)+8 damage.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory and equipment from getting harmed (5.10).
Acid                    These attacks can destroy items in your inventory.
                        They can also damage your equipment if you don't
                        resist acid.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your charisma.
                        Acid bolts do (level/3)+(7d8) damage.
                        Acid balls do (level*3)+15 damage.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory and equipment from getting harmed (5.10).
Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Damage of these attacks is capped
at 1200 (always before resistances are applied).
If you resist them, the damage will be cut to 1/3. If you are susceptible to
them, like Ents to fire, you will take twice the damage! This also applies for
aura attacks like hitting someone who wears a cloak of immolation.
To prevent side-effects of the attacks on your inventory from occurring you
will need the according immunity! Resistance is only sufficient to protect
your equipment, not your inventory.
Magic rods are always immune to all kinds of attacks.

Poison          Poison resistance doesn't belong to the basic resistances but
                is also very essential at the beginning. If you resist poison
                you will not only take just 1/3 of the poison damage but also
                be protected from poisoning effects.
                Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Poison breath
                caps at 800.

Make sure that you have the basic resistances as soon as possible, and poison
resistance before going far deeper than 1500 ft.
Poison balls (also known as Stinking Clouds) do 12d2 damage.

There are also five minor resistances:
Fear            While you're afraid you won't be able to attack a target in
                close combat.
Blindness       You cannot read scrolls or books while you're blind.
                Blindness can be caused directly by a blindness attack or by
                indirectly by light or darkness attacks if you don't resist
                those. You still can use magic staves, rods or wands and
                quaff potions. Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or
                Cure Critical Wounds will remove the blindness.
Confusion       While confused you cannot move, shoot or fight straight.
                Further, you're unable to read scrolls or books.
                However, you still can use staves, wands and rods.
                Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or Cure Serious/Critical
                Wounds will remove the confusion.
                Resisting confusion or chaos will lower damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Confusion damage caps at 400.
Paralysis       Paralysis can be caused by bashing doors, lack of food and by
                traps or enemies. Against the latter two effects you can
                become immune by equipping a 'Free Action' item. You should
                become immune to paralysis before descending below 1000 ft.
Hold Life       This will provide some protection against experience drain.

Further, there are several high resistances. Those are
Water           Water resistance is rare. Water attacks can stun and confuse
                you if you don't resist them and usually do a lot of damage.
                Resistance will cut damage to 1/3.
                If you're a mimicking an aquatic monster the damage will be
                further cut down to 1/4.
                If you don't wear a 'tarpaulin' items in your inventory might
                be destroyed by the water (if they don't resist water).
                Water bolts do (10d10)+level damage.
                Water balls do 50+(1...[level*5/2]) damage.
Sound           Sound attacks do less damage but can stun your or even knock
                you out so you will die as if you were paralyzed. Free Action
                won't help you then.
                Resistance will cut damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Damage is be reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Thunderlord -also known as
                Dragonrider- eats a firestone and gets the 'adrenaline'
                message. See (5.9) for firestone details.)
                Sound resistance will protect you from stunning effects.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Sound breath caps at 400.
Shards          Shard attacks can cause nasty cuts that makes you bleed
                heavily if you don't resist them.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage is be reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Thunderlord -also known as
                Dragonrider- eats a firestone and gets the 'adrenaline'
                message. See (5.9) for firestone details.)
                Shard resistance will protect you from cuts.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Shard breath caps at 400.
Nexus           Nexus attacks can have extremely nasty side-effects if you
                don't resist them. Those are
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Teleport you towards the monster.
                -Teleport you a dungeon level higher or lower.
                -Swap two of your six stats randomly!
                -Destroy items in your inventory.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3. Nexus breath caps at 250.
Chaos           Chaos attacks can also have nasty side-effects if you don't
                resist. These are:
                -Confuse you.
                -Let you hallucinate.
                -Drain some experience. Resisting 'Nether' will also prevent
                 this.
                Resisting chaos will also make you resist confusion attacks.
                Resistance will cut down damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Chaos breath caps at 600.
                Raw chaos invocation (chaos ball) does (level*4)+(10d10) dam.
Light           Light effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                If you are mimicking a monster that is susceptible to light
                you will suffer double damage from attacks.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Light breath caps at 400.
Darkness        Darkness effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Darkness breath caps at 400.
                Darkness Storms (balls) do (level*5)+(10d10) damage.
Nether          Having 'Hold Life' can protect from experience loss.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent life
                draining (experience loss).
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Nether breath caps at 550.
                Nether bolts do 30+(5d5)+(level*3/2) damage.
                Nether balls do 50+(level*4)+(10d10) damage.
Disenchantment  This attack does massive damage and can also disenchant your
                equipped items, lowering their to-hit/to-dam/to-ac bonus!
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent
                disenchantment of your equipment.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6, it caps at 500.

Irresistable/extremely powerful effects:
Force           Pure force impact (BR_WALL). Raw damage is monster HP/6.
                Force impact (breath only) is capped at 200 and irresistable.
                If you lack sound resistance you will get stunned.
Inertia         Inertia attacks will slow you down a lot. There is no 'Inertia
                resistance' but 'Free Action' will slightly reduce the
                slowdown duration.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/6 and caps at 200.
Gravity         These attacks have very annoying side-effects:
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Slow you down.
                -Stun you if you don't resist sound.
                It's impossible to resist gravitation. However, having
                'Feather Falling' (also known as Levitation) will reduce the
                damage your body takes from the shockwave and cut the damage
                to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/3 and caps at 150.
Mana            Mana is pure magical energy. There are only rumours
                about items that provides resistance against it.
                Resisting it will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3, breath caps at 250. Only very
                few monsters (mostly uniques) can breathe mana.
                Mana bolts do 50+(1...[level*7/2]) damage.
                Mana storms (balls) do (level*5)+(10d10) damage. Beware!
Time            Time is pure temporary distortion. There are only rumours
                about items that provides resistance against it.
                Time attacks can have very nasty side effects:
                -Drain experience (Hold Life won't help).
                -One of your stats can be lowered (resistance will reduce the
                 amount).
                -Drain all your stats (resistance will prevent this).
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3. Time breath caps at 150.
Meteor          This is an irresistable attack of pure impact.
                <Meteor attacks are currently not implemented.>
Disintegration  This is an irresistable attack of raw destruction.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/3, capping at 300.

Combined effects:
Ice             Ice attacks combine shard & sound effects with cold damage.
                Ice damage (bolt only) is (6d6)+monsterlevel.
                Ice damage consists of 60% cold damage and 40% shards damage.
                Missing sound resistance will result in additional stunning.
Plasma          Plasma attacks combine raw force and immense heat.
                Fire immunity will cut damage to 1/5.
                Fire resistance will cut damage to 3/5.
                Plasma resistance (only mimics that use a plasma-breathing
                form) will cut damage to 3/7..3/12.
                Also has stun effect if sound resistance is missing.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Plasma breath caps at 150.
                Plasma bolts do 10+level+(8d7) damage.
Radiation/Nuke/ This is a poisonous attack that can have acidic effects on
 Toxic Waste    your inventory.
                If you resist poison
                - you will just take 2/5 of the damage
                - you will be protected from being poisoned
                - your equipment will be safe from acidic damage.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3 and caps at 800.
                Nuke balls (radiation balls) do (level*3)+(10d6) damage.
Rocket          Rockets combine shard & sound effects with heat influence on
                your inventory and shard damage to the player. Rockets do
                insane damage.
                Rocket damage is monster HP/4, it caps at 800.
                Shard and sound resistance will lower damage to 5/6 each,
                fire resistance will lower damage to 4/5, fire immunity to
                3/4 (overriding fire resistance).
                (Rockets are treated internally like breathing.)


Immunities
----------
Players can become immune to the basic elements, poison and water by wearing
items (for excample dragon scale mails of the corresponding colour) or by
transforming into a monster shape that carries the according immunities
(see (6.7) about mimicry details).
If a player is immune to an element, (s)he won't take any damage from those
attacks or any side-effects. Example: Wearing a Black Dragon Scale Mail
which provides Water Immunity makes the player take 0 damage from a water
bolt attack and also protect him from the stun+confuse effect of water bolts.
(It won't protect him from the stun/confuse effect of other attacks though.)


Susceptibilities
----------------
Some monsters are susceptible against certain elements. For example fire
hounds are susceptible against cold attacks.

Physical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in a doubled multiplier for
branded attacks. Example: If the player hits a Cold Hound with a
fiery broad sword (2d6) the Cold Hound will receive 2d6 * 6 damage
instead of 2d6 * 3 (usual brand multiplier for melee weapons).
Also see (5.4) for a table of brand multipliers.

Magical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in double damage for the
according elemental attacks (ie cold ball vs fire hounds).

Magical/monster attacks vs players:
Players can be susceptible against an element too. For example Ents are
susceptible to fire by nature. Immunity will completely cancel out the
susceptibility. If an Ent wears an item of fire immunity it will suffer
0 damage from fire attacks, same as any other character.
If a susceptible player without immunity is hit by the according elemental
damage type, the damage will be doubled!
If a player is susceptible to an element and at the same time wears an item
that provides resistance then both factor in: Damage = Damge * 2 / 3.
(If the player also has temporary resistance then the damage will be
multiplied by 1/3 once more, as usual.)


Branded attacks in PvP
----------------------
Branded physical attacks in pvp are not influenced by susceptibilities.


Melee attacks of monsters
-------------------------
See (5.11) for details about melee attacks and melee damage caps.



(5.7) Qualitative classification of items, identifying & selling items
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items are classified by
-a basic item type
-a simple magical enchantment (to hit-chance, to damage, to armour class)
-an ego power (some items even have two ego powers at once),
 (some examples: resistances on armours, elemental brands on weapons,
 enhanced brightness on light sources. The item carries the names of its
 ego powers. For example an 'acidic long sword of gondolin' has been
 blessed with two ego powers: 'acidic' and 'gondolin'. For more information
 about ego powers see (7.4) Spoiler Files).
-sometimes you may find an artifact which can have quite a bunch of
 different powers combined!

If you find an item, it's 'unidentified'. That means you see only the
basic item type.
Example:
A whip {+,?} (1d6)
The ? indicates that you don't know yet which level is required to wield
this item. You have to identify the item to find out more about it.
(The (1d6) means that this weapon has one 6-sided dice rolled to determine
its damage afflicted to your target.)

Assuming you identify it you could get one of the results below:

Example 1:
A whip {+,1} (1d6) (+0,+3)
This is a magical whip. Magical, because its damage is enchanted to +3.
It doesn't possess any further special abilities.

Example 2:
A Fiery Whip of Gondolin {+,24} (1d6) (+8,+11) (+3)
This is an ego-weapon ('of Gondolin') with a fire brand ('fiery'). The
base weapon type is a whip which makes it belong to the hafted weapons.
Its to-hit and to-damage are magically enchanted to +8 and +11.
Gondolin weapons increase strength and constitution (here +3).

Ego-items or excellent magical items often have varying abilities.
For example a Gondolin-weapon _can_ have HOLD_LIFE, a high resistance,
or increase your dex. It doesn't _have to_, however. Some Gondolin-Weapons
have different abilities than others. To find out the complete powers of an
item it can be neccessary to *identify* it.
*Identify* (same as *Perception*) reveals the complete ability list.
You can check the complete list of items in stores by pressing 'x' to
'examine an item'. You can review the ability list of an item in your
inventory or equipment using the 'I' key. Using 'I' requires that
you already *identified* the item or bought it from a shop.
Items that are bought from a shop are always automatically *identified*.
Some shops offer an *identify* service but they are quite expensive.

If you sell an item to a shop the offer you will receive depends on
the following:

Item is not identified at all -> the offered cash will equal the value of the
                                 basic item type, eg 300 Au for a long sword
                                 or 20 Au for an unknown potion.

Item has been pseudo-identified -> shops won't buy items that have a bad
                                   pseudo-identification. 'average' items will
                                   sell for the value of the basic item type.
                                   good/excellent/special items will sell for
                                   their basic value too so you better
                                   identify them to get more money for them!

Item has been identified -> the shop will pay you fully for all those boni
                            that are either very obvious (like +STRength or
                            Extra Attacks or Life/Mana) or which are always
                            granted to this kind of ego item (for example
                            'weapons of *Slay Evil*' always give 'ESP evil').

                            However, the shop won't offer money for 'hidden'
                            abilities like resistances or ESP which aren't
                            obvious and which are randomly bestowed upon
                            this type of ego item. (Most ego items have
                            one or more random powers!)
                            To make the shop pay for these unknown powers
                            too you'll need to fully identify the item,
                            this is called *identifying* (note the asterisks).
                            To do this, there are scrolls of *Identify*,
                            staves of *Perception* as well as the spell
                            'Greater Identify'.
                            If your item turns out to lack any hidden powers
                            you wasted the *Identify* scroll, but that's not
                            a big deal.

Item has been identified and is a true artifact -> the shop will pay a fixed
                                                   price which is predefined
                                                   for each true artifact.
                                                   You don't need to *ID* it.

Item has been identified and is a randart -> Shops will usually offer between
                                             10,000 and 15,000 Au for unknown
                                             randarts, but never more than the
                                             item is really worth. You should
                                             _always_ *identify* your randarts
                                             to discover all their hidden
                                             abilities, so shopkeepers will
                                             pay a lot more.

Item has been identified and is cursed -> the shops never buy cursed items.
                                          That might change if you uncurse
                                          it and if the item hasn't only bad
                                          (negative) boni on it.

Shop prices in general may slightly vary depending on the shop owner's race
and your character's race.

Sometimes an item turns out to be an artifact!
Artifacts are unique. If an artifact is owned by a player, noone else
can find it anymore until it's lost (for example if the player dies)
or sold to a shop. Depending on a server's configuration artifacts
usually stay a while in the shop and can be bought by other players
before they finally disappear from the stock.

There are static artifacts and random artifacts ('randarts').
Static artifacts are predefined and have fixed abilities. Their number
therefore is limited.
In case all static artifacts are found, players can still find randomly
generated artifacts so a server won't run out of artifacts.
Artifacts of any type cannot be enchanted by any means.

If a player holds an unidentified item long enough he/she might get
a 'feeling' about it. The more points in 'Combat' skill the player has
the faster and clearer he can feel the items value. This is called
'pseudo-identifying'. Warriors are more likely to pseudo-id than casters.
If a player pseudo-ids an item, the 'feeling' will be appended in { }
brackets to the item name.
Note that archers or casters will also become better at pseudo-id'ing,
if they train the 'Archery' or 'Magic' skill respectively.
'Archery' at level 11 helps to get more detailed ('excellent' too instead of
just 'good') feelings about ranged weapons and ammunition.
'Magic' at level 11 helps to get more detailed ('excellent' too, instead of
just 'good') feelings about magic items, potions and scrolls.

Items display the following pseudo-id tags:

-Basic items, non-magical:      {average}
-Magically enchanted items      (good}
-Excellent magical items        {excellent}
-Artifacts (random & static)    {special}
-Cursed items                   {cursed}
-Useless items (often cursed)   {worthless}
-Cursed artifacts / egos        {terrible}
 Note that some cursed artifacts can be very powerful.

Note that potions and scrolls don't have 'egos' or 'artifacts', but some of
the pots/scrolls show similar pseudo-id tags.



(5.8) Special abilities of items
--------------------------------
FEATHER ('It allows you to levitate.')
        'Feather Falling', also called 'Levitation'.
        Lets you resist gravitation effects. Lets you float down gently
        if you accidentally stumble into pits.
FLY     ('It allows you to fly.')
        Allows you to cross water areas without drowning. Enables you to fly
        over trees (running won't work, try walking field by field).
MANA ('It affects your mana capacity')
        Will increase your total spell points (mana) by +x0%. Example:
        Gloves of the magi (+3) increase your mana by 30%.
        MANA items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
        They have slightly less effect on non-mages and quite less effect
        on priests or paladins who need wisdom rather than intelligence.
LIFE ('It affects your hit points')
        Will increase your total hit points by +x0%. Example:
        Sword of life (+2) increases your HP by 20%.
        LIFE items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
        The maximum total +LIFE bonus a character can achieve is +3 (cap).
        (For mimics, the +LIFE effect might be less since their HP in
        player form or monster form might be low. The +LIFE isn't applied
        to mimics' final HP but the lower base HP.)
AGGRAVATE ('It aggravates nearby creatures')
        Wakes up all monsters in whose radius of awareness you are.
LUCK ('The item increases your luck')
        If you are lucky, your chance to find better items increases.
        Luck caps at 40, having higher bonus won't help any more.
        The higher your luck is, the more diminishing is the effect of
        increasing it even more.
NO_MAGIC ('Antimagic shell')
        Raises your saving throw to 95%, making you nearly immune to any
        malicious magical influence (like paralysation). Also prevents
        you from using any magic device or casting spells.
ANTIMAGIC ('Antimagic field')
        Prevents you from using any magic device or casting spells, also
        applies to nearby enemy spellcasters and other players. The
        field has less influence on _party members_ who try to cast.
        The radius is approximately the field power / 15. The field
        power is the chance of suppressing a spell. It caps at 80%.
BLESSED ('It has been blessed by the gods')
        These weapons resist cursing. Priests can use blessed weapons
        without penalties, even if they are not 'hafted' (blunt).
VAMPIRIC ('The weapon drains life from your victim')
        Drains life from your victim, which you gain as hit points.
        For details see '(5.15) Vampirism'.
VORPAL ('Sharp' weapons, 'It is very sharp and can cut your foes.')
        Has a chance that the weapon damage dice result is multiplied on
        hitting, you'll see 'Your weapon cuts deep into your enemy'.
        The multiplication is done after brand/slay effects have been applied,
        so brand/slay effects will increase VORPAL efficiency.
CHAOTIC ('Your weapon produces chaotic effects')
        On hitting, you have a 50% chance to do one of the following:
        a) drain life (VAMPIRIC, see (5.15)) (very likely)
        b) earthquake (see (5.13))
        c) confuse target (very likely)
        d) teleport target away
        e) polymorph target
IMPACT ('It can cause earthquakes')
        Causes earthquakes if the damage is > 50. (See (5.13).)
WOUNDING ('It is very sharp and makes your foes bleed.')
        Has additional to-hit/to-dam bonus.
CAPACITY (of Capacity) ('It can hold more mana.')
        No effect currently.
CHEAPNESS (of Cheapness) ('It can cast spells for a lesser mana cost.')
        No effect currently. Traps of cheapness have halved timeout duration.
EASY_USE (of Simplicity)
        You have a much higher chance of succeeding to use the magic device.
CHARGING (of Charging) ('It regenerates its mana faster.')
        This magic device (rod) will take only 1/3 of the usual time to
        fully recharge.
FAST_CAST (of Quickness) ('It can cast spells faster')
        Using this magic device will only consume HALF a turn of your time.
Istari (of the Istari)
        Combination of CAPACITY, CHARGING, CHEAPNESS and FAST_CAST.
FUEL_LITE ('It provides light radius when fueled')
        A light source that needs to be fueled, otherwise it runs out.
(NO_SEED 
        An ego item that is never created randomly (in terms of abilities
        or power).)
CURSED, HEAVY_CURSE, PERMA_CURSE, AUTO_CURSE,
CURSE_NO_DROP, TY_CURSE, DG_CURSE
        See (5.14) Curses.
INSTA_ART
        This item always is an artifact; it has no base-class that can spawn
        non-art items. Example: Long Sword base class can spawn regular long
        swords, but also 'Elvagil'. A Phial however will instantly be
        'artified' and turn into Phial of Galadriel or Undeath. There are no
        base-type non-art phials in the game.
SPECIAL_GENE
        These artifacts are 'special artifacts' that cannot be dropped by
        regular monsters but require a certain key monster to be killed.
        For example the Suit of Mardra can only drop from Mardra (there is no
        guarantee that she will always drop it though).



(5.9) What does item xxx do exactly?
------------------------------------
Some items might look bad (Mushrooms of Unhealth), but keep in mind that you
can often throw ('v') these items to damage or impair an enemy.
For more information about items and especially ego items see (7.4).


Weapons & Armour
--
Dark Sword      Dark Swords have a so-called 'antimagic field', which
                prevents the user from using magic items or casting spells,
                but also has a chance to interrupt enemy spellcasters.
                The chance to interrupt spellcasters is 50% minus the to-hit
                and to-dam values of the dark sword. Dark Sword (+3,+4) has
                50-3-4 = 43% chance of interrupting spellcasters.
                The radius of the antimagic field is several fields, getting
                smaller if the chance is smaller than 50%.
                Dark Swords never give more than 50% AM, even if tohit and
                todam boni added together result in a negative number.
                They also never give 'negative antimagic', 0% AM is the
                minimum, even if tohit+todam are greater than its AM.
                AC boni on Dark Swords won't affect the antimagic field.
                The antimagic chance of a dark sword stacks with the
                Antimagic skill (see 6.2).
Magic Arrows    Those will return into your quiver magically, so you need only
                one of them really. Same goes for artifact ammunition of any
                type. (Magic Arrows can be destroyed by fire or acid though.)
Shadow Cloak    Makes you hard to spot for other players, regarding
                a) them seeing you
                b) them being able to look at your current equipment.
                Shadow Cloaks work especially well to further disguise
                yourself while being invisible vs. someone who is able to see
                invisible creatures/players. See '(5.16) Invisibility'.
Dragonrider Coat        Resists heat & cold.

Word of Recall  Use it to quickly travel from the town to a dungeon or tower,
                it can also be used to travel between towns or on the worldmap
                in general. See (0.3) Important Inscriptions.
Blood Bond      Inscribe this @P<playername>, for example @PGandalf, then read
                it to form a blood bond between you and that player. (Only one
                of you has to read a BB scroll, it's working bidirectional).
                Now you can hostile each other and fight in a friendly duel.
                The loser won't suffer a real death but just get teleported
                away. The hostility will automatically be cancelled when the
                blood bond ends. Everyone will receive messages about a blood
                bond being formed ("<player A> blood bonds with <player B>")
                and about the result ("<A> wins the blood bond against <B>").
Remove Curse    Breaks lesser curses on items, allowing you to unwear or
                destroy them. Note that many items can be sold for good cash
                as soon as they are uncursed!
                Also, non- or uncursed items that induce random teleportation
                can be inscribed .. to have the teleportation stop (compare
                (0.3 Important Inscriptions).
                (It gives you the message:
                'You feel as if someone is watching over you.'.)
*Remove Curse*  Breaks heavy curses. Note that curses (including heavy ones)
                on weapons or armours can also be broken by enchanting one of
                their boni some points above +0.
Recharging      Recharges a magical rod/wand/staff.

                of monsters and objects. Can save you!

                a radius of 3 worldmap sectors.

                Drains your HP for each one removed.
                The race will be determined by the monster which stands
                closest to you when firing off the spell. For each monster you
                will suffer 4+(monsterlevel/8) points of damage, which cannot
                be absorbed by any magic shield or other protective effects!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining
                hit points might be halved (extra penalty) after the spell
                finished (this penalty is enabled by default).
                Monsters have a chance to resist genocide, depending on their
                level. Monsters inside vaults, Uniques, and monsters that are
                immune to teleportation attacks cannot be genocided.
Mass Genocide   Removes all monsters that are close to you.
                Drains your HP.
                All monsters within a radius (equal to your sight range)
                around you are annihilated. For each monster you will suffer
                3+(monsterlevel/8) points of damage, which cannot be absorbed
                by any magic shield or other protective effects!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining

                produces better results mostly.

Vermin Control  Stops breeders on the map from multiplying.
wilderness Mapping  Maps the wilderness area around the worldmap sector you

                    an inscription telling the location of a hidden dungeon.
Cancellation    Don't use it! It can heavily disenchant magic items in your
                inventory. It hasn't got a useful purpose.
Parchments      These contain informations about the game, they won't
                disappear if you read them.

Amulet of Anti-Magic    See '5.7 NO_MAGIC'
Amulet of Anti-Teleportation    If worn it will suppress all attemps to
                                teleport, phase or recall on the whole level!
                                This can be very dangerous but also very
                                helpful since it affects both players as well
                                as monsters.
                                Any word-of-recall that is cast while
                                teleportation is supressed will be suspended
                                and then immediately kick in as soon as the
                                amulet is taken off. This allows some
                                interesting tactics..

Mushrooms with bad effects are also often poisonous.



(5.10) Destruction of items by elemental attacks
------------------------------------------------
Items in your inventory can be destroyed if you are hit by an elemental
attack. Those attacks even have a very slim chance of destroying an item
that you have equipped!

In order for an item to guaranteedly survive such an attack, you must either
be immune or double-resisting (have permanent AND temporary resistance) to
that specific element. (Double resistance is nearly as good as immunity.)
Some items have IGNORE_xxx flags which let them ignore certain elements,
preventing them from being destroyed.
All artifacts, random and static ones, cannot be harmed by elemental attacks
of any type.

Here is a table of items and which elements they are susceptible against:
"Impact" happens if you fall into a pit, smashing some potions on hitting the
floor. Items that IGNORE_COLD also resist impact damage.
Usually items that contain wood, leather or stuff are susceptible to fire and
acid, while things that consist only of metal are just susceptible to acid.

Items, even tomes, resist certain elements if they have the according

or -in case of tomes- according content :)
For example a Tome of the Eternal Flame cannot be harmed by fire.



(5.11) Armour Class vs monster attacks, damage caps
---------------------------------------------------
Armour class helps you twice:
-It makes monsters miss you more often.
 The more AC the better, it's weighed against the level of the attacking
 monster. If the monster is (heavily) stunned it gets penalties here.
-It reduces the damage if a monster manages to hit you.
 This effect caps at 150 AC!

Monsters can score critical hits which can (depending on the attack type)
result in a cutting or stunning effect against the player.
A monster scores a critical hit if it inflicts a damage which is very close to
its theoretical maximum. Weaker monsters (that don't inflict high amounts of
damage) aren't able to score critical hits at all.
The power of the resulting cut/stun depends on the damage too.
So a high armour class helps a lot, to avoid critical monster hits and to
reduce their power.

Monsters have a cap on melee attacks, which limits their attacks to an
_average_ of 700 total damage points per _turn_ (Monster, depending on their
race, can perform up to 4 melee attacks each turn they can move/act). Note
that the monster may attack for more damage, it's just the averaged value.
Wearing armour will further reduce the total average damage you can expect to
take per turn from that monster.
Sanity-draining melee attacks are capped at 55 points of _average_ sanity
damage per _blow_ (not per round).

Note that there are melee attacks that cannot be reduced by armour. It depends
on the way the melee attack is performed. See (5.12) for details.



(5.12) Monster attack types and brands
--------------------------------------
Monsters can strike you with branded attacks, for example acidic hits, or hits
that poison you if you get hit. If you resist the according brand you won't be
affected by it alot, and the overall damage will be reduced. If you're immune
you won't be affected at all and only take a physical part of the damage -
if there is a physical part. This depends on the attack type.
Here is a list of attack types and brands:

Brand           Needed resistance       Type      Contact/Cut/Stun/Bypasses AC
-------------------------------------   --------------------------------------
HURT            Only AC - raw damage.   HIT                            +/+/+/-

                EAT_FOOD/EAT_LITE.
UN_BONUS        disenchantment.
UN_POWER        none.(drains charges/energy from your items)
                Magic Device skill helps to prevent draining though.

DISEASE         poison. This attack
                can also decrease
                your constitution.
SANITY          none. (mimics using a
                WEIRD_MIND/EMPTY_MIND

FAMINE          none. Makes you hungry.
SEDUCE          none. Makes you take off
                equipped items.
SHATTER         hits & causes an
                earthquake.
                Very dangerous.
                See (5.13).

Getting hit by higher undead creatures may also infect you with the
Black Breath! (See 1.5 for more information about Black Breath.)



(5.13) Earthquakes
------------------
Earthquakes will cause ceilings to collapse and the ground to shift and crack,
burying items, players and monsters and inflicting a lot of damage.
All fields in a certain radius around the epicentre have a certain chance to
be filled with rocks, to be cleared from previous obstacles (walls) and turn
into empty floor fields, or to remain untouched and unchanged.

Players don't take damage from their 'own' earthquakes, caused by their
equipment or items (weapons of earthquakes, scrolls of *destruction*).

Earthquakes can deal up to 300 damage if you cannot evade the falling rocks
and shifting ground: Depending on the number of unchanged (by the earthquake)
empty fields that are adjacent to your character, there is a chance to 'evade'
and take much less damage or even none at all. Earthquakes can also stun you.



(5.14) Curses
-------------
Several items you find will be {cursed}!
Cursed items usually have bad effects that outweigh or dominate their useful
abilities, and you cannot take them off once you equipped them, as long as
the curse isn't broken. Cursed artifacts and ego items are pseudo-id'ed as
{terrible}. Shops won't buy cursed items, they might buy the item after the
curse is broken, however.
If you equip an unidentified item and it carries a curse your character will
notice 'Oops, it feels deadly cold!'.

There are different types of curses:
CURSED          can be broken by a regular 'remove curse'.
                Item cannot be taken off until the curse is broken.
HEAVY_CURSE     requires a strong '*remove curse*' to be broken.
                Item cannot be taken off until the curse is broken.
PERMA_CURSE     This curse can never be broken.
                Item can never be taken off again! Mimics polymorphing into a
                form that cannot wear the specific item won't succeed either.
                There is absolutely no way to get rid of this item. If you
                find a way then you found a bug =).
CURSE_NO_DROP   these items cannot be dropped from inventory as long as the
                curse isn't broken. CURSE_NO_DROP occurs together with
                CURSED or HEAVY_CURSE or PERMA_CURSE.
AUTO_CURSE      occurs together with CURSED or HEAVY_CURSE.
                If the curse is broken, AUTO_CURSE items will automatically
                recurse themselves as soon as the item is equipped, taken off,
                or picked up. To get rid of an AUTO_CURSEd item that you don't
                need anymore (d)rop it to the ground after the curse has been
                broken. If you had the item equipped, don't take it off but
                (d)rop it to the ground right from your equipment! Otherwise
                it will recurse itself.
TY_CURSE        Randomly drains stats sometimes, even if the item is uncursed.
                (TY_CURSE will stay, even if the 'normal' curse is broken!)
                Lowers the items value by 15000 Au.
                ("It carries an ancient foul curse.")
DG_CURSE        Rarely summons a random monster on you, even if uncursed.
                (DG_CURSE will stay, even if the 'normal' curse is broken!)
                Greatly lowers the items value by 25000 Au.
                ("It carries an ancient morgothian curse.")

If 'CURSED' and 'HEAVY_CURSE' occurs on a weapon or armour piece, the curses
can alternatively be broken by enchanting the item's stats above +0.
Each enchantment of any of their stats (to-hit, to-dam, to-ac) above +0 has
a certain chance to break the curse. This can often be cheaper than buying a
*remove curse* scroll for HEAVY_CURSE items.



(5.15) Vampirism
----------------
Weapons and other items that you can equip may by 'vampiric' (see (5.8)),
meaning that they drain life from your target.
Mimics who use a vampire form will also get a vampiric 'brand' on their melee
attacks (see (6.7)).

Vampiric life draining heals you with a part of the damage you afflicted on
your target each hit! The more damage you deal and the more attacks per round
you have, the more life you will leech back. There's a maximum amount of HP
which you can leech from a victim per round (usually around 50..100).

The best case is to have vampiric flag on a weapon, that will drain at maximum
efficiency. If you use vampiric equipment like gloves, they will be a bit less
efficient than an actual vampiric weapon, meaning that you won't leech on
_every_ hit (the amount of leeched life per hit is not penalized though).
For ranged weapons it doesn't matter which part is vampiric, the bow or the
ammunition. It won't increase your over all life leeching if both are
vampiric either.

In general, vampiric flags don't stack from multiple items! Just the item that
fits the situation better (weapons) overrides the weaker ones (non-weapons).
Note that vampirism from mimicked forms only works on melee combat and has a
50% chance to go off (except for vampire bat which has 100%) due to a half of
vampires' attacks being normal hits and the other half being biting (which
does the actual leeching!).



(5.16) Invisibility
-------------------
A player who is invisible is harder to spot for monsters, making them move
eratically instead of directly targetting the player. This also helps against
casters, archers or breathers who won't be able to target you as well (often)
as they usually could. Being invisible costs your body a lot of effort,
resulting in getting hungry quickly.

Invisibility won't work at all on monsters that..
        -are invisible too.
        -special quest monsters (Sauron, Morgoth).
        -are Dragonriders, they have ESP.
        -nonliving monsters with empty mind (not using optical senses).

All other monsters are randomly affected by the player's invisibility,
meaning that they will only sometimes be able to spot him (they will see the
player kind of 'flickering').
The closer a monster is, the better its chances to spot the player.
Some monsters have better chances to spot the player, depending on
        -distance to the player,
        -level of the player (higher level = harder to spot),
        -monster class (Dragons, demons, undead, animals, never sleeping
                        monsters and smart monsters are better at it;
                        orcs, trolls, stupid monsters are worse),
        -the vision power of the monster,
        -the level of the monster,
        -player carrying a light source, doubles the chance of spotting him,
        -player wearing an aggravating item, further triples the chance.

Invisibility also affects other players:
If another player is invisible and of higher level than you..
        -you can see him if you can see invisible and he's not wearing a
         shadow cloak;
        -otherwise he'll be completely invisible to you.
If another player is invisible and not of higher level than you..
        -you can see him easily if you can see invisible and he's not wearing
         a shadow cloak;
        -you see him 'flicker' if you lack seeing invisible or if he's wearing
         a shadow cloak (or both). He will fade in and out of your sight.
         The lower his level, the more often you will be able to see him.
         If you want to look at his equipment then you'll need some timing,
         might take several tries.
Invisibility (on players) overrides ESP. So it does help in a (blood bond)
duel even if the opponent has ESP.



(5.17) How abilities, resistances and boni stack
------------------------------------------------
The same resistance from two or more items in your equipment don't add to each
other. For example you only need one item that provides fire resistance. If
you equip two such items you won't get better resistance than with just one
item. You cannot get "double resistance" from two items' permanent resistances.
This rule applies to all resistances and abilities that don't use a bonus
number to indicate their effectiveness, like faster mana recharging or hit
point regeneration, telepathic powers, slow digestion, etc.

However, there is a way to further increase your resistances temporarily:
Use an item that provides some temporary resistance. Temporary resistance and
permanent (such from your equipment) resistance stack and their effects are
multiplied! For example if you wear a shield of resist fire and you quaff a
potion of resist heat you'll have double fire resistance as long as the potion
lasts, resulting in fire damage being cut down to 1/9 instead of 1/3! This is
nearly as good as having fire immunity. (1/3 perm res * 1/3 temp res =
1/9 total res).
Not only potions can boost your resistances temporarily, some items can also
be activated for temporary resistance, for example cloaks of lordly resistance
or elemental protection rings or certain artifacts.

Stat increases or ability increases that are not 'flags' (flag means you either
have it or you don't) but that use bonus numbers will add to each other.
For example an orcish shield (+2) that increases your strength by +2 and a
kolla (+1) which also increases your strength (just by +1) will add up and
your character's strength will be increased by +3 in total!
Same goes for IV (Infra-Vision), luck, extra attacks, speed, etc.

There are some abilities which are not flags although they might look like it.
In fact, they add up / stack. Those are:
-Extra shots (concerning ranged weapons)
-Extra might (concerning ranged weapons)
-Drain mana (note that 'mana regeneration' does NOT stack. So it can cancel
 out the effect of only ONE item that drains mana, not of any more.)
-Drain hit points ('Drains your life'. note that 'regeneration' does NOT
 stack, so it can cancel out the effect of only ONE item that drains hit
 points, not of any more. However, the 'Health' skill is able to further
 increase your regeneration rate.)
-Extra light radius



(6) Tables
==========
(6.1) Attributes
----------------
Depending on your race and class you will have different character attributes.
These stats are always modified randomly a bit, so two characters of the same
race and class still don't have completely identical values here.
Here are questions that are related to your character attributes.
The attributes are also called 'stats'.

Stats are displayed as values from 3 (minimum) to 18. It is possible to gain
even higher stats, those will be displayed as 18/xxx where xxx is roughly the
value above 18 multiplied by 10 (to allow fractions). Examples:
18/10 is like 19.
18/120 is like 30.
18/47 is like 22. The fraction 0.7 is not factoring into actual gameplay.

If you quaffed the maximum of "stat potions" (potions raising your stats), the
maxed out attribute will be displayed in light umber.
An attribute is maxed out at 18/100 +/- racial/class modifiers.
Examples:
Human Adventurer has 18/100 + 0 + 0 = 18/100 cap for all stats, see (6.4) for
race boni and (6.5) for class boni.
Thunderlord Istari has an intelligence cap of 18/100 + 2 (Thunderlord) + 3
(Istari) = 18/150.

Stats can be raised over the character's cap by equipment. The total possible
maximum of an attribute is always 18/220 (40), which is displayed as 18/***.

Strength (STR)
    -How heavy may your weapon and bow be? You can't fight with a weapon that
     is too heavy for you.
    -How heavy may your armour be? You will lose mana or Martial Arts abilties
     if it's too heavy for you.
    -How much damage do you inflict on enemies?
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
Intelligence (INT)
    -How much mana for spellcasting do you have?
    -How well can you cast spells?
    -How well can you handle and use magic devices?
Wisdom (WIS)
    -How well can you cast priest prayers? (certain spells that are for
     priests)
    -How well can you resist malicious influences like poison, paralyzation,
     or insanity?
    -Wisdom directly increases your sanity. Be careful! If you're very low on
     sanity taking off a +wisdom item can mean your death, in case your sanity
     drops to 0 by taking off the item.
Dexterity (DEX)
    -Has positive influence on your armour class and on your chance to hit
     enemies, also quite important for ranged weapons.
    -How well can you steal (from shops)? (A high DEX won't help much if your
     'Stealing' skill is zero by the way ;)
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
Constitution (CON)
    -How many HP (hit points) do you have? Very essential.
     Note that CON effect caps depending on your character level. Roughly:
     At level 20 you can't utilize more than 18/60 CON. That means even if
     you raise your constitution above that value, your Hit Points won't
     increase as long as your character is level 20.
     At level 30, CON cap is 18/130, at level 40 it's 18/190, and at level
     45 and higher the full CON bonus is utilized for determining Hit Points.
Charisma (CHR)
    -Do you get good prices in shops? :)
     Note that shop prices also depend on racial preferences of the
     shopkeepers vs their customers. It is said, that Half-Trolls have an
     especially hard time.



(6.2) Skills, opposed skills
----------------------------
If you rise in character levels by gaining experience, you also get skill
points to distribute on various abilities. To invoke the skill system overview
press 'G' (capital G!). Skill points that have been distributed can not be
taken back.

Here is a list of the available skills and brief explanations to each one:
Note that not every skill is available to every profession (class).

+Combat                         Lets you wear heavier armour without spell
                                point penalties.
                                Ability to pseudo-ID items: You can sense
                                if items are terrible, worthless, cursed,
                                average, good, excellent or special.
                                At the beginning you will only feel 'cursed'
                                or 'good'.
                                Raise combat skill to at least 11 to get
                                more distinctive feelings about melee weapons
                                and armour.
                                A powerful combattant (combat 31) senses the
                                use of ranged weapons and ammunition much
                                better, even if (s)he's not comfortable with
                                archery.
                                A very powerful one (combat 41) can also sense
                                the use of magical items much better.
                                The further you train Combat, the faster you
                                will pseudo-id items.
                                Increases Fear/Stun/Confuse duration of the
                                target (if attacking causes those).
                                Slightly increases melee and ranged to-hit
                                bonus, and melee to-damage bonus.
    +Weaponmastery              Improves your Fighting ability.
                                Slightly increases melee to-dam and to-hit for
                                armed combat. Increases your chance to score
                                critical hits in armed combat.
        +Sword-mastery          Greatly improves to-dam/to-hit with swords.
                                At 25 and 50 you will get +1 blow per round
                                while having a sword equipped.
            .Critical-strike    Increases your chance to score hits of
                                extremely high damage. This skill improves
                                the chance to score critical hits and adds
                                to critical-hit bonus from your equipment.
                                NOTES ABOUT CRITICAL-STRIKE SKILL:
                                Critical-strike skill only helps light swords,
                                not heavier than 10.0 lb., while critical-hits
                                items will work with all weapons.
                                NOTES ABOUT CRITICAL HITS IN GENERAL:
                                You can always score critical hits,
                                independent on weapon class and crit-skill.
                                Martial artists can score critical hits too.
                                The probability will be small though, if you
                                don't have +critical hit items or this skill
                                to help out. Critical hit bonus on items
                                counts slightly more than the skill, and it
                                is applied to melee AND ranged attacks!
                                For weapon users the weight of their weapon
                                affects their critical hits:
                                If your weapon is lighter than 10.0 lb, your
                                chances to score a critical hit will further
                                increase.
                                Above 10.0 lb, the chance to hit your target
                                critically won't be worse than with a 10.0 lb
                                weapon.
                                Although your chance of hitting critical spots
                                is better with lighter weapons, the damage of
                                your critical strike -IF you manage to execute
                                one- is higher if your weapon is heavier.
        .Axe-mastery            See Sword-mastery
        .Hafted-mastery         See Sword-mastery
        .Polearm-mastery        See Sword-mastery
    +Archery                    Improves ranged to-damage bonus.
                                Increases your chance to score critical hits.
                                At 10 you may create ammunition from bones,
                                skeletons and rubble on the floor (press 'm').
                                (You can't pick up rubble; if you want to make
                                ammunition from it, just stand next to it!)
                                In order to create ammo, you need to wield the
                                appropriate ranged weapon before you try:
                                Bow/crossbow for bones, slings for rubble.
                                Lets you pseudo-id ranged weapons and
                                ammunition easier if raised to at least 11.
                                At 20 the quality of your handmade ammunition
                                becomes remarkably better.
                                50 in archery grants +1 'extra might',
                                increasing your launcher's multiplier by 1.
                                NOTE: The extra might bonus does not apply
                                to Boomerangs! All other boni do apply.
        .Sling-mastery          Imcreases hit chance (while using a sling).
                                At 16,32,48 you will get +1 additional shot
                                per round each (while using a sling).
                                (Note: Number of shots per round is capped at
                                5 in total, so Extra Shot forms won't make
                                mimics better archers than true archers.)
                                Also reduces the chance of your ammunition to
                                shatter from 50% at skill 0 down to 10% at 50
                                (only concerns ammo for slings).
                                Artifact ammunition never breaks.
        .Bow-mastery            See Sling-mastery, analogue
        .Crossbow-mastery       See Sling-mastery, analogue
        .Boomerang-mastery      See Sling-mastery, and also increases ranged
                                to-damage bonus while using a boomerang, and
                                reduces the chance of a boomerang to break.
                                Skill 0 -> 2% chance. Skill 50 -> 0,1% chance.
                                Artifact boomerangs never break.
    .Martial Arts               Ability to fight with bare hands.
                                Slightly raises you character speed.
                                Lets you attack with special combat styles.
                                At 10 you receive Feather Falling (Levitation).
                                At 15 your character gets fear resistance.
                                At 20 your character gets confusion resistance.
                                Gives you 'Free Action' (immunity to paralysis)
                                at skill level 25.
                                At 30 you're able to swim without problems.
                                At 40 your movement is perfected enough to
                                cross even highest mountains.
                                At 50 a martial artist will learn the
                                technique of flying!
                                Under certain conditions MA abilities cannot
                                be used and lose their effect, see (5.3)!
                                The dice of martial arts special techniques
                                (which your character will use automatically
                                depending on your MA skill) are affected by
                                elemental brands, but slightly less than
                                normal weapons (2/3 as much).
                                Martial Arts gives you a chance / adds to your
                                chance of intercepting an enemy! See
                                'Interception' skill below.
                                For more details about MA see section (5.3).
+Magic                          Improves your spellcasting abilities and
                                increases your mana capacity.
                                Lets you pseudo-id magic items, potions and
                                scrolls easier if raised to at least 11.
    .Magic-device               Ability to use magic devices (wands,rods,etc.)
                                without failing. Also increases their power.
                                Speeds up recharging of rods you carry (1.5x).
    .Spell-power                Increases the power of learned spells by
                                adding a bonus to the spell level.
                                At 50, it will raise spell levels by 40%.
                                (It won't raise the level of spells which you
                                haven't learned yet.)
    .Sorcery                    Ability to use all magic schools!
                                Comes at the cost of your hit points!
    .Mana                       Ability to use spells of the Mana school.
    .Fire                       See Mana
    .Water                      See Mana
    .Air                        See Mana
    .Earth                      See Mana
    .Meta                       See Mana
    .Conveyance                 See Mana
    .Divination                 See Mana
    .Temporal                   See Mana
    .Mind                       See Mana
    .Nature                     See Mana
    .Udun                       See Mana
    .Mimicry                    Ability to shapechange into a monster!
                                You also inherit the monsters abilities,
                                weaknesses and resistances!
                                To find out details about a monster form
                                look into the file r_info.txt in your
                                tomenet/lib/game directory!
                                (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)
+Sneakiness                     Slightly increases your character speed
                                (+7 at 50, so approx +1 every 7..8 points).
    .Stealth                    Increases your stealth, which determines
                                if monsters can hear you from a distance
                                or if you can sneak past them. Note that even
                                Thunderlords -also known as Dragonrider-
                                can become stealthy by using this! (Without
                                further +stealth items, stealth of a TL
                                Adventurer will become 'poor' instead of 'bad'
                                with Stealth at 26.000.)
    .Disarming                  Improves your disarming ability.
    .Trapping                   Improves your ability to set traps:
                                Gives you a higher chance to successfully
                                place a trap if a monster is close to you and
                                trying to interfere. Also, monsters will have
                                a harder time to discover your traps.
                                Last but not least you learn to optimize your
                                traps for higher damage output.
                                See (4.7) for details about monster traps.
    .Backstabbing               Lets you backstab enemies, afflicting high
                                damage. Works best in the dark and if the
                                opponent is sleeping.
    .Stealing                   Ability to steal (from shops)! Very nasty >:)
                                If you get caught, you will be on the
                                'blacklist of merchants' for some minutes up
                                to 2 hours, depending on the item you tried to
                                steal from a shop. During this time it's
                                basically impossible to steal, and you will
                                get BAD prices (blackmarket-style) in shops.
                                Your blacklist timer won't decrease while you
                                are /afk!!.
                                Your chance to steal an item from a shop
                                depends on your dexterity, your stealing skill
                                and the price and weight of the item. Stealth
                                and invisibility are also helpful.
                                For example it's nearly impossible to steal a
                                large piece of wood without the store owner
                                noticing it, although it's not worth much :)
                                There's always a minimum chance of 5% to fail!
                                You need to be at least level 5 to steal.
                                You have a chance to successfully steal an
                                item even if your stealing skill is 0 and your
                                dexterity low. Everyone could try to steal..
                                If a shop offers an item more expensive than
                                it actually is (black market) that has no
                                effect on stealing. The 'normal' item value
                                is used to calculate the chances.
                                It's more difficult to steal from special
                                stores (expensive black market and especially
                                rare footwear/jewellry/secret black market).
                                It's a good idea to wear as many +DEX items
                                as possible while trying to steal from a shop.
                                Stealth and invisibility might also help.
    +Dodging                    Ability to evade attacks. Doesn't work well
                                if you wear heavier armour.
        .Calmness               Ability to not get hindered by enemies.
                                Adjacent foes can interfere if you try to..
                                -shoot with ranged weapons
                                -use a void jumpgate
                                -invoke a mimic spell
                                -set a monster trap.
        .Interception           Ability to interfere with adjacent enemies.
                                Can prevent them from teleporting, casting,
                                summoning, running away. The chance to
                                intercept an enemy is (2 * interception) +
                                (martial_arts_skill / 2) - (enemy_level / 3).
                                Example: Chance to intercept summoning of the
                                Balrog of Moria with maxed interception is
                                (2*50) + 0 - (50/3) = 84% base. Now since it's
                                spellcasting it's reduced to 75%: 84%*75%=63%.
                                For Morgoth it's (2*50)+0-(100/3) = 67% base.
                                To intercept his spells it's 75% of 67% = 50%!
                                (A maxed out martial artist would have 69%.)
                                Interception chance is recuded to 33% while
                                you are blind.
                                Interception chances also depend on what the
                                enemy is trying to do. Certain actions are
                                harder to intercept, those reduce the chance
                                further, to..
                                100%    for shooting
                                 85%    for running (fleeing / stepping back)
                                 75%    for casting a spell / summoning
                                 50%    for teleporting / phasing (blinking)
                                Note: While ball/bolt attacks are spells,
                                      breathing is NOT.
                                Interception chance caps at 80% (cap is
                                applied after all other penalties have been
                                factored in, at the very end of calculation).
+Necromancy                     Drains life from killed monsters
                                (higher monster level and skill -> more HP).
    .Aura power                 Increases the power of your auras.
                                NOTE: Aura skills only affect the chance of
                                the corresponding aura to react to an attack,
                                not their damage. The damage/duration of all
                                auras is only increased by 'Aura power'.
                                (Aura power doesn't affect auras from items,
                                for example fire auras of cloaks.)
    .Aura of Fear               Monsters that hit you are stroke by fear.
    .Shivering Aura             Monsters that hit you are stunned.
                                At a skill of 30 the aura is so strong that
                                your melee attacks (weapon as well as martial
                                arts will be branded by it. (Cold brand.)
    .Aura of Death              Monsters that hit you are hit by waves
                                of plasma and ice.
                                At a skill of 40 the aura is so strong that
                                your melee attacks (weapon as well as martial
                                arts) will be branded by it.
                                (Alternating fire or cold brand.)
    .Antimagic                  Generated from your strong disbelief in magic
                                an anti-magic field surrounds you, preventing
                                attempts from other casters to cast spells or
                                summon monsters. This effect is cumulative
                                with the anti-magic field of a Dark Sword.
                                (See 5.9 for more info about dark swords.)
                                It's capped at 80% chance of interrupting
                                enemy spells.
                                Note that as soon as you invest a point into
                                this skill you won't be able to use any magic
                                wands,staves or rods anymore!
                                This skill also slightly affects your fellow
                                party members (casters).
                                Each point in Antimagic adds 0.8% to your
                                AM chance, so the max gain is +40% from skill.
                                Note: While ball/bolt attacks are spells,
                                      breathing is NOT.
                                Antimagic will also reduce the duration of all
                                timed magic effects on you, be it good or bad.
                                Warriors that specialize in Antimagic are
                                called 'Unbelievers' (The Anti-magic powers
                                result from their strong disbelief in magic).
+Health                         Increases your hit point regeneration rate:
                                (skill_level * 2)% chance to regenerate 1,5x
                                the normal amount of HP per turn (stacks with
                                REGEN items).
                                Also helps you to recover from temporary stats
                                drain, hallucination, blindness, paralysis,
                                confusion, slowness, poison, stun and cuts
                                faster.
                                If you spend 10 points into Health, your
                                sanity will be displayed as a bar.
                                At 20 points you'll get the percentage
                                displayed. At 40 the value will be shown.
    .Training                   Increases the chance of getting an additional
                                skillpoint or even a stat-point on level ups.
                                Note that all characters already have a slim
                                chance to get an additional skill/stat-point
                                on level ups even without Training skill.
                                The weaker an attribute is, the more likely
                                it's raised. (This stat increase counts like
                                a stat potion you'd quaffed.)
                                Everytime you gain a level, a random number
                                between 0 and 99 will be generated. If it's
                                smaller than your Training skill, you will
                                receive an extra skill point.

    .Free Action                You need this at 01.000 to resist paralysis.
    .Confusion Resistance       You need this at 01.000 to resist confusion.

In my opinion, the sub-skills of 'Health' should be avoided. There are more
important skills to care about. Also see (7.5) for suggestions about skill
point distribution.

Here is what the numbers mean (we will use the Axe-Mastery skill for this
example:

+Combat                         10.500  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               5.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-Mastery            15.000  [0.500]

As we can see this player has 10.5 skill points in Combat, 5.25 in
Weaponmastery and 15 in Axe-Mastery. He just reached a new level and hence
gained 5 skill points. Now he decides to invest them all into Axe-Mastery.
He presses <DOWN> key until the Axe-Mastery line is selected. Now he presses
<RIGHT> key 5 times to invest all his 5 spare skill points here.
Axe-Mastery will be increased by 0.500 points per invested skill point (hence
the [0.500] on the right), leaving him at 17.5 Axe-Mastery now.
Since sub-skills always slightly affect their parent skills, Weaponmastery
and Combat will also be raised slightly. The result might look like this:

+Combat                         10.750  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               6.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-Mastery            17.500  [0.500]


Opposed skills
--------------
Some skills don't go well together, and will have negative influence on each
other when increased, decreasing their opposite!
Take care on the following combinations:
        Weaponmastery   <->     Sorcery
        Archery         <->     Sorcery
        Martial Arts    <->     Sorcery
        Anti-magic      <->     excludes any type of magic and magic-devices,
                                including mimicry.
                                However, a mimicking player won't lose his
                                current form on training in Anti-magic.
                                He just won't be able to transform ever again.



(6.3) Abilities
---------------
Depending on your race and class, you will be better or worse at certain
abilities. You can see your abilities in the character screen (press 'C').

Fighting
    How well you can fight, how easily you get disarmed.
Bows/Throw
    How well you can shoot/throw.
Saving Throw
    How well you can resist attacks that have influence on your status
    other than just hit points. For example poisoning, confusion or
    paralyzation.
Stealth
    Determines if monsters will immediately wake up if you're nearby or if
    you are able to sneak past sleeping monsters without waking them.
Perception
    Determines how easily you spot hidden traps or doors on adjacent fields
    without even searching for them.
Searching
    Determines how easily you spot hidden traps/doors on adjacent fields
    while explicitely searching for them (with 's' or 'S').
Disarming
    How well you can disarm traps (without setting them off), and how likely
    you avoid them if you accidentally step on a field that contains one.
Magic Device
    How well you can use magic items like wands, staves, rods (these are often
    especially hard to use) or activate magic items like Dragon Scale Mails.
Blows/Round
    How often per round you are able to strike with your weapon. This depends
    on your strength, dexterity, your class, your weapon. (Note that Yeeks
    are limited to 4 blows per round.)
    Spending points in specific weapon masteries will give you an additional
    blow at 25 and at 50 (like sword or hafted mastery).
    Tables of blows/round limits are at (5.3) (for martial arts) and at (6.5)
    (for melee weapons).
Shots/Round
    How often per round you are able to use your ranged weapon.
    Spending points into specific archery skills will give you additional
    shots at 16, 32 and 48 skill points.
    Mimics get additional shots per round if the monster form they use has
    the ability to shoot with ranged weapons.
Spells/Round
    How many spells per round you can cast. Usually 1.
Infra-Vision
    How far you can see warm-blooded monsters in the dark.
    10 ft equal a distance of 1 field.
    Having this above zero can be very helpful for fighting monsters while you
    are blinded, since IV still works then.

Note that your age, height, weight, social class and gender don't have
influence on the gameplay at this time.



(6.4) Races
-----------
Depending on your race, you might need different amounts of experience to gain
a new character level. You also might have certain intrinsic abilities.

and click 'Doc' in the menu on the left.
(Descriptions here are partially taken from www.tomenet.net )
For Beginners a powerful but simple race/class combination like Half-Troll
Warrior is strongly recommended.

Human
    Humans are allrounders with no special weaknesses or strengths.
    Humans have no experience penalties and tend to go up levels faster than
    most other races. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters
    choosing human.
    Humans are very good at 'Training'.
Half-Elf
    Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as strong.
    Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws,
    stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
    Half-elves resist light intrinsically.
    They get bonus on 'Bows-Mastery' and 'Trainig'.
Elf
    Elves resist light effects intrinsically and see invisible creatures.
    Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at fighting.
    They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans or half-elves and
    also have better wisdom.
    Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and
    magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
    Elves get bonus on 'Bows-Mastery', 'Magic', 'Stealth', 'Dodging',
    'Calmness' and 'Sneakiness'.
Hobbit
    Hobbits have their dexterity sustained. Further, they get a dexterity bonus
    from not wearing shoes! Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows,
    throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching
    disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but
    prefer to be called burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good
    at melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect
    warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Hobbits resist black breath somewhat.
    They get bonus on 'Sling-Mastery', 'Stealth', 'Sneakiness' and 'Dodging'.
Gnome
    Gnomes are intrinsically protected to paralysis effects. Gnomes are smaller
    than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the hobbits, live in the
    earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent Warlocks & Sorcerers, and
    have very good saving throws. They are good at magic, searching, disarming,
    perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are
    not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision,
    so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance.
    Gnomes receive bonus on 'Crossbow-Mastery', 'Magic' and 'Digging'.
Dwarf
    Dwarves can never be blinded and at level 30 they learn to travel across
    even the highest mountain regions.
    Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
    are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
    or priest. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less
    intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat
    wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very
    good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one big
    drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud
    voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out
    challenges at nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable
    stealth.
    They receive bonus on 'Axe-Mastery' and 'Digging'.
Half-Orc
    Because of their preference to living underground to on the surface,
    Half-orcs resist darkness intrinsically. They make excellent warriors and
    decent priests, but are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at
    stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs
    are quite ugly, and tend to pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make
    good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to
    have great constitutions and lots of hit points.
    They get bonus on 'Backstabbing', 'Disarming', 'Necromancy' and receive
    slight penalties on 'Magic' and 'Sorcery'.
Half-Troll
    Half-trolls have their strength sustained. They are very strong, but also
    very stupid and slow. They make great warriors and iffy priests. They are
    bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly
    that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. Half-trolls have their
    strength sustained and also happen to be fun to play. They need to eat
    often.
    Half-Trolls get bonus on 'Hafted-Mastery', 'Health' and 'Swimming'. They
    receive larger penalties on 'Magic' and 'Sorcery'.
Dunadan
    Dunadain have their constitution sustained. Dunadain are a race of hardy
    men from the West. This elder race surpasses human abilities in every
    field, especially constitution. However, being men of the world, very
    little is new to them, and levels are very hard for them to gain.
    A Dunadan gets bonus on 'Combat', 'Magic' and 'Archery'.
High-Elf
    High-elves can see the invisible and resist light and the flow of time
    intrinsically. They are a race of immortal beings dating from the
    beginning of time, masters of all skills, strong and intelligent, although
    their wisdom is sometimes suspect. They do very well in all professions.
    There are few things that they have not seen already, and experience is
    hard for them to gain.
    High-Elves receive bonus on 'Bow-Mastery', 'Magic', 'Stealth', 'Dodging',
    'Calmness' and 'Sneakiness'.
Yeek
    Being weak and losing many childhood fights, they have learned the
    ability to float gently to the ground. They have intrinsic feather
    falling (same as 'levitation' effect).
    Yeeks are the least powerful of all the races. They suffer disadvantages
    in all stats and have attributes similar to humans. However, to
    compensate Yeeks learn, and thus gain levels, extremely quickly.
    Yeeks don't receive boni or mali on any skills.
Goblin
    Goblins resist darkness intrinsically. Goblins have a decidedly
    mixed reputation. They are almost always grinning, and more often than
    not you cannot tell whether or not they are eyeing you like a side of
    meat. They are as sturdy as Dwarves and are quite agile making them
    good fighters, rogues, and mimics. Being creatures of the night,
    Golbins have natural resistance to darkness.
    They receive bonus on 'Boomerang-Mastery' and 'Stealing'.
Ent
    The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world,
    eldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the
    land, they were summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth.
    Being much like trees they are very slow but strong and do not have
    to eat as often. Because they consist of wood, they are quite
    susceptible to fire and they don't drown in water. As the Shepherds
    of the Trees, they can learn to sense the presence of others, such
    as animals  at level 10, orcs at 15, trolls at 20, giants at 25,
    dragons at 30, demons at 40 and all evil-minded creatures at level 50.
    Ents can pass trees. At level 4 they learn to see invisible things.
    Trees will slightly bend aside to let ents pass through. They accumulate
    experience very slowly. Ents do not eat normal food, but are able to
    consume liquids. Ents resist the force of unleashed water.
    They get boni on 'Health', 'Calmness' and on the magic schools 'Earth' and
    'Water' and they receive penalties on 'Fire' school.
Thunderlord (also known as Dragonrider)
    Thunderlords can eat firestones to temporarily boost their powers.
    They have an intrinsic telepathic vision of all nearby creatures, the
    radius expands as they gain levels. At level 5 they can spot dragons
    anywhere on the level. They even gain intrinsic basic resistances,
    fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20 and electricity at 25. At level 30
    they learn how to fly. Thunderlords are not very wise, and need a very
    long time to gain experience. They need to eat often. Thunderlords have
    feather falling (levitation) from birth. See (5.9) for firestone details.
    They receive bonus on 'Polearm-Mastery', 'Aura of Fear' and the magic
    schools 'Conveyance' and 'Fire'.

(Di:Disarming,      MD:Magic Device,        ST:Saving Throw,    St:Stealth,
Pe:Perception (sight range), Sr:Searching,  Fi:Fighting,        BT:Bows/Throw)
Note that Yeeks are limited to 4 melee attacks per round (not including boni
from skills or items yet).

(6.5) Classes/Professions, titles, melee blows/round
----------------------------------------------------
Depending on your class, your start-up equipment and your skill tree will
vary. For example a warrior cannot learn magic spells.
To see numerical tables about races and classes, visit http://www.tomenet.net/
and click 'Doc' in the menu on the left.
(Descriptions here are partially taken from www.tomenet.net )

Adventurer
    Adventurers can train nearly all skills, but are not very good in a
    specific one. Their magical power is basing on their intelligence as well
    as wisdom.
Warrior
    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
    by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
    a magical device. Their prime stats are Strength and Constitution, and a
    good Dexterity can really help at times. A Warrior will be good at melee
    and bows, but bad at most other skills. A Warrior learns no magic but can
    train to use magic devices. A warrior has more attacks per round than any
    other class.
    Warriors can decide to become 'Unbelievers' by spending points into
    the 'Anti-magic' skill. As soon as they spend the first point here
    they will immediately become unable to use any magic wand/staff/rod!
    The full opposite of Sorcerers, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
    not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in
    the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally incompetent when
    trying to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read
    scrolls. Because they are so unattuned to magic, Unbelievers can prevent
    magical gates from opening around them, eventually extending to a complete
    suppression of teleportation abilities and all magic in the area around
    them.
    Warriors can also become monk-like fighters, by training the Martial Arts.
    The warrior class is recommended for beginners.
Istari (elvish word for Mage)
    Istari use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have
    to cast spells and how low their failure rate is.
    They are the all-around best magicians, having the most powerful spells.
    A high-level Istari can be very powerful , but getting there can be a
    difficult journey. On the downside, they are the worst fighters, being
    unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and still unable
    to be anything even remotely approaching effective with it.
    An Istari and especially Sorcerer (that's an Istari who specializes in
    'Sorcery' skill) also has the fewest hit points of any class, making
    survival difficult in the beginning.
    This class is not recommended for beginners.
Priest
    Priests use certain divine magic. Unless mages they have a fair
    fighting potential with hafted or blessed weapons. Priests can learn
    many spells that are helpful to their party members. Priests use mainly
    wisdom for their prayers, determining the amount of mana and how low their
    failure rate is.
    A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
    to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
    fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their church!
    They are very good with magical devices, preferring to call them
    instruments of their god, but are not as good as a Istaris in their use.
    Priests also have excellent saving throws due to divine intervention.
    Priests make decent fighters, preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.
    Wisdom is the priest's primary stats.
    Note that priests get a penalty for wielding non-hafted weapons, except
    for BLESSED weapons which priests can use without problems independently
    of their type.
Rogue
    Rogues can backstab (works especially well in the dark) sleeping or
    fleeing monsters, and they can train stealing from shops, creatures
    or players. Due to their high dexterity they can often hit several
    times per round with light weapons.
    A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by cunning, but is capable of
    fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and locks, no
    device is impossible for him to overcome. A rogue will learn to set many
    kinds of traps as they become more experienced. Rogues have very high
    stealth allowing them to sneak around many creatures without having to
    fight, or to sneak up and get the first blow, backstabbing his opponent.
    A rogue's perception is higher than any other class, and usually they
    notice traps or secret doors without needing a search. Rarely will a
    rogue be unable to avoid or disarm a trap. Rogues also have the unique
    ability to train stealing from his fellow man, a dangerous but sometimes
    very rewarding profession. Rogues are better than warriors or paladins
    with magical devices, but still can not rely on their performance.
    Rogues can also learn a few spells. A rogue's primary stats are
    Intelligence and Dexterity. 
Mimic
    Mimics can learn how to shapechange and use monsters' forms, thus
    inheriting nearly all of the monster's abilities. Mimics learn forms
    by killing as many of a certain monster type as that type has a high
    level. Further, their 'Mimicry' skill must be at least 1/2 of the
    monster level. If mimics kill monsters whose level is higher than
    2 x their mimicry skill those kills will nevertheless be counted in
    case the skill is raised to the appropriate level later.
    Example: To use the form of an Ancient Bronze Dragon (level 40) the
    mimic has to kill 40 of them and have a mimicry skill of at least 20.
    To find out how many monsters you already killed and how many you need
    in total to learn a form, press the '~' key followed by '3'.
    To polymorph into a form, press 'm' key, like casting a magic spell.
    (Forms that have DISBELIEVE ability are skipped when using the normal
    'Polymorph Self' spell. You have to use 'Polymorph Self Into..' if you
    want to use these forms.)
    To find out the special abilities of a monster form, see section (6.7).
Archer
    Archers aren't good at fighting, but can deliever extremely high damage
    with their ranged weapons. They can die quickly too, however.
    Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
    around with any bow/xbow/sling but are especially powerful with bows.
    An Archer is very bad at melee, being only better than the Sorcerer.
    Archers can create ammunition from the bones of their opponents.
Paladin
    Paladins are a combination of warrior and priest. Holy knights that
    fight the evil with hammers and swords as well as divine support.
    Paladins are nearly as strong as pure warriors. They cannot become
    unbelievers.
    Paladins are not very good at missile weapons. They are poor at 
    stealth, perception, and searching. They are better than fighters
    with magical devices and have a decent saving throw due to divine
    protection. Their primary stats are strength and wisdom, although
    intelligence can slightly help too.
Ranger
    Rangers are a combination of warrior and mage. They are also skilled
    trappers and devoted to nature. They cannot become Unbelievers.
    They are good fighters, and quite effective with bows, second only to
    Archers. Rangers have good stealth, perception, searching, saving
    throws, and are good with magical devices. Rangers are a
    jack-of-all-trades class who can find several different ways out of
    any situation. They use intelligence for spellcasting, same as mages.
    At level 20 rangers learn to find paths passing thick woods.

If you raise in levels, you will get new titles. These are displayed between
your class name and your character level in the main window. If you die and
become a ghost, the title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.
Titles change every 5 levels, the final Title is received on level 50.
From level 70 and upwards there are special titles available which probably
very few players will ever acquire.

Here is a table showing boni/mali of the different races:
'Blows/Round' is the maximum number of melee attacks per round a character can
have basing on strength and dexterity and on the weapon's weight.
To that maximum of blows per round further boni are added, like extra blows
from a specific weapon-type mastery or from rings of extra attacks or magical
influence from priest prayer 'Zeal'.
Note that these blow/round limits don't count for Martial Arts users (as long
as they fight barehanded). See (5.3) for a table of MA attacks.

(6.6) Sanity
------------
Your sanity can have the following values:
Sound, Sane, Weird, Insane, Mad, Vegetable.
If you spend 10 points on your 'Health' skill, the sanity display will turn
into a bar, displaying exacter values.

At the beginning, your sanity is always 'Sound'. That means you are completely
sane. Monsters or traps can reduce your sanity. If your sanity drops to zero,
your mind will be qualified as an unthinking vegetable, this means your
character is permanently dead, so be extremely cautious! Fortunately there are
potions available that cure your sanity, although they are not very common and
cannot be bought in shops. Wisdom helps against insanity by inceasing your
'sanity capacity'. As you gain levels, your sanity capacity will also increase.
However, this means IF your sanity drops to dangerous regions, you will need
more potions to cure it.

If your sanity is lowered, there's an increasing chance that flashbacks will
storm your head, leaving you with mad visions for a while..



(6.7) Mimic details, polymorph rings
------------------------------------
If a mimic polymorphs into a certain monster form, abilities and stats will be
averaged between the normal ('@') body and the form. In most cases if the form
is performing worse than @-form in a certain ability, the @-form will dominate
and the ability will be only slightly worse than normal.
The averaging is done because the mimic with all his equipment polymorphs into
the target form. It's not like the polymorphing is done first and afterwards
armour, weapon or jewelry is equipped.
So wearing a ring of protection for example won't plainly add to the mimic's
AC but just contribute to the @-form AC which is then averaged in the process
of determining the final form's AC.
How exactly stats are calculated is written below for each case.

To find out the special abilities of a monster form, consult the file
/lib/game/r_info.txt in your tomenet directory, and look up the monster.
(See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)
It's abilities will transform to the mimic's body as follows:

W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
  depth:
    The depth is also the basic level of these monsters. It tells you how
    many of them you need to kill to learn mimicking their form.
  corpse weight:
    The weight of the form has impact on its stealth. A huge form that weighs
    a lot will give a stealth penalty, while small and light forms may give a
    bonus.
I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
  speed:
    110 means normal speed. If the monster is faster, the mimic will
    receive a speed bonus of 50% of the monster's speed above 110.
    If the monster is slower, the mimic will receive a speed malus of
    30% of the monster's speed malus below 110.
    So a monster moving at 130 speed will give the mimic +12 speed.
  hit points:
    The monster's hit dice xdy are multiplied and then capped against ~2500,
    so gain might decrease in higher regions. (Cap details: The monster HP is
    calculated by the following formula before further calculations are made:
    monster HP = 100000 / ((100000 / hdice*hsides) + 18) .)
    Now, if the mimic's HP are less then the result, the mimic's HP will
    become approx. ((3*x*y) + (2*normal_HP)) / 5. (2/5 monster HP, 3/5 player
    HP.) If the mimic's HP in player form (0) are greater than x*y, the
    resulting HP will be ((x*y * 4) + (mimic_HP * 1)) / 5.
    (1/5 monster HP, 4/5 player HP!)
  armour class:
    Mimicking a monster is already a very difficult task. By changing
    shape, the usual armour class of the monster will magically influence
    the armour class of the player.
    Depending on the body parts of the monster, its AC has different
    influence on the player. The following formula helps:
    body_influence = 0.
    if the monster has a head, body_influence is increased by 1.
    if the monster has a torso, body_influence is increased by 3.
    if the monster has arms, body_influence is increased by 2.
    if the monster has legs, body_influence is increased by 1.
    calc_ac = monster_AC * 14 / (7 + body_influence)
    Now if calc_ac is smaller than the player's AC, the final AC will be
    (3/4 player_base_AC) + (3/4 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/4 calc_ac).
    Otherwise, the final AC will be
    (1/2 player_base_AC) + (1/2 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/2 calc_ac).
  vision:
    Searching ability of the player =
    (player_searching / 2) + (monster_vision / 10)
    Perception of the player = 
    (player_perception / 2) + (monster_vision / 10)
E: weapons : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
    These values indicate how many pieces of equipment the player can
    wear while using this form. For example snakes can only wear a helmet
    (E:0:0:0:0:1:0).
    NOTE: Mimics can never wear MORE items than in their normal form. So
    even a form with 8 legs would allow only 1 pair of boots to be equipped!
B: attack method : attack effect : damage
  attack effect:
    If the monster poisons or infects with disease, this will result in
    a poison brand. Similar it's for fire/cold/lightning/acid attacks.
    BLIND won't work on monsters that have NO_SLEEP, otherwise the target
    will be confused.
    HALLUCINATION and CONFUSE won't work on monsters that have NO_CONF,
    otherwise the target will be confused.
    TERRIFY won't work on monsters that have NO_FEAR, otherwise it'll
    scare the target.
    PARALYZE won't work on monsters that have NO_STUN, otherwise it'll
    stun the target.
    EXPxx means the monster drains life on attacking. The player will
    receive HOLD_LIFE (resist life-draining attacks) from this form.

    Monster effects (like poisoning or paralyzing) are applied to
    the player's attacks with a probability that corresponds to their
    rarity over the up to 4 monster attacks per round. Example:
    If the monster has 3 blows per round and one of them is poisoning,
    the other two are paralyzing, the mimic will have 1/3 chance to do
    a poison branded attack and 2/3 chance to do a stunning attack.

    These effects won't be applied if one of the following conditions
    is met:
    a) The player is doing a ranged attack.
       (Effects only work with melee attacks!)
    b) The player uses a weapon but the monster doesn't have an
       equipment slot for melee weapons, because it has no arms or is
       immaterial - see the E:... line of that monster in r_info.txt).

    Melee to-damage bonus also depends on the monster form:
    The monster damage dice for each attack are multiplied and the products
    are all added up, the result is divided by 4. If the monster can't use
    melee weapons (no equipment slot for melee weapons), the result will
    be doubled (after it was divided by 4).
    The result is now capped against 200, the closer this graph comes towards
    200 the flatter the curve will become.
    This value is now compared against the player's melee to-damage bonus.
    If (monDam > toDam) then newToDam = 1/2 toDam + 1/2 monDam.
    If (monDam < toDam) then newToDam = 3/4 toDam + 1/4 monDam.
    So the monster damage has only a small influence if it's lower than
    the player's to-damage bonus, but it has a high influence if the
    monster is more powerful than the player.

    The chance for an attack effect to go off is (number of blows with
    this effect) / (total number of monster blows). That means a Ghoul
    has 2/3 chance to execute a poison branded melee attack, and 1/3
    chance to perform a stunning melee attack.
    monster's blows 
F: flag list
    The flags are translated to mimic abilities as follows:
    RES_xxx     Gives the mimic the specific resistance.
    IM_xxx      Gives the mimic the specific immunity! If a form offers
                more than 1 immunity, one will be picked randomly, the
                remaining ones will turn into resistances. Potions of
                self-knowledge are helpful here.
    PASS_WALL   Will allow the mimic to pass walls like a ghost.
                These immaterial forms also drain the hit points of their
                user.
    KILL_WALL   The mimic will dig *easily* through walls.
    REGENERATE  Faster hit point regeneration.
    CAN_SWIM    The player can pass water fields without problems.
    CAN_FLY     The player can fly.
    STUPID      -2 intelligence.
    SMART       +2 intelligence.
    NO_CONF     Confusion resistance.
    NO_FEAR     Fear resistance.
    NO_SLEEP    Free action.
    NO_STUN     Sound resistance.
    NO_CUT      The player can't be cut and won't bleed continously from
                wounds.
    DISBELIEVE  Will increase the player's anti-magic field by
                ((monsterlevel / 2) + 20) percent. The range of the anti-magic
                field is increased by ((monsterlevel / 15) + 3) fields.
    ARROW_1     The player will receive an additional shot per round with bows
                since the monster seems to be good at shooting.
                If the monster shoots 1_IN_3 or better, the player will
                even receive 2 extra shots with bows!
                (Note that the number of shots per round is capped at 5!)
    HURT_ROCK   Means that this creature has a rock-like skin and body.
                Takes damage from Stone-To-Mud and takes more damage from
                'disintegration' attacks, but at the same time resists shards!
    WILD_WOOD or ANIMAL
                The player (like the monster) can pass trees.
    WILD_MOUNTAIN or WILD_VOLCANO
                The player (like the monster) can climb mountains.
    WILD_TOO without any other WILD_xxx flags:
                Combines all WILD_xxx effects (such as WILD_WOOD and
                WILD_MOUNTAIN)!
    INVISIBLE   The player becomes invisible.
    AURA_FIRE or AURA_ELEC
                The player receives an aura.
    SUSCEPT_FIRE/SUSCEPT_COLD/SUSCEPT_ELEC/SUSCEPT_ACID/SUSCEPT_POIS
                The player is susceptible against these attacks. Dangerous!
    WIERD_MIND  Insanity attacks are reduced by 25%. (Overrides S-flags)
    EMPTY_MIND  Insanity attacks are reduced by 50%. (Overrides S-flags)
    AQUATIC     Gives superb water resistance.
    NEVER_MOVE  Using this form, the player won't be able to move (except for
                teleportation/phasing/recalling).
    RAND_25     The player has +10% chance of moving randomly.
    RAND_50     The player has +20% chance of moving randomly.
    OPEN_DOOR   This form can open doors.
    BASH_DOOR   This form can bash doors
                (useful to forms that cannot OPEN_DOORs!).
    EVIL        This form will take 2x damage from holy orbs or holy fire.
    HURT_LITE   This form will take 2x damage from light attacks.
S: spell list
    These spells can be cast by the monster. Most of them are available to
    the mimic too, some of them have slightly different effects.
    Depending on how frequently the monster is able to cast spells, the player
    gets boni on intelligence and mana! This only applies if the spells are in
    fact magic spells, not if the monster cannot do anything except firing
    missiles, shrieking or shooting arrows (etc).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_3, the player receives +1 INT and
    +10% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_2, the player receives +3 INT and
    +30% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_1, the player receives +5 INT and
    +40% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).
    About specific spells:
    BR_xxx      (breathing) will give the according resistance to the player
                (if that specific attack CAN be resisted at all).
    BR_PLASMA   gives plasma & fire resistance.
    BR_GRAVITY  gives feather falling (levitation).
    BR_INERTIA  gives free action.
    MIND_BLAST  Insanity attacks are reduced by 25%.
    BRAIN_SMASH Insanity attacks are reduced by 50%.

Especially interesting spells of mimics are 'Blink' (Phase Door) and
'Teleport'. These usually cost very little mana and can be very helpful,
so you might want to create macros for them.

WARNING:
You can try to cast a monster spell even if you don't have sufficient spell
points for it! This may or may not work, and there's a possibility that you
will faint and become paralyzed for a few turns (Free Action won't help) as
well as your health being damaged (constitution will be decreased).

Further, certain races and classes get abilities (even if they are not
mentioned in r_info.txt for monster forms):
Bats        Feather falling (levitation)
Elves       Resist light
Dark elves  Resist darkness
Hobbits     Dexterity bonus of +2 for not wearing shoes.
Gnomes      Free action
(Dwarves    Blindness resistance, climbing at level 30.)
High-elves  Resist light, see invisible
Yeeks       Feather falling (levitation)
(Ents       Slow digestion, speed - 2, sensitive to fire, see invisible at
            level 4, can swim, pass trees)
All ghosts  See invisible, Infra-vision +3
All orcs    Resist darkness
All trolls and giants
            Sustain strength
All dragonriders
            ESP_DRAGON at level 5, feather falling (levitation),
            flying at level 30.
All undead creatures
            Resist darkness, blindness, poison (usually immunity);
            can't bleed (no_cut), infra-vision +1, insanity attacks are
            reduced by 25%.
All greater demons (capital 'U')
            Resist poison (in most cases immunity).
All non-living creatures
            Resist poison (usually even immune) and fear; insanity attacks
            are reduced by 50%.
All vampires and vampire bats
            Chance to drain life on attacking in melee.
            Vampire bat form has 100% chance to do a vampiric attack,
            real vampire forms have 50% chance (half their attacks are hits,
            the other half is biting). For details see '(5.15) Vampirism'.
All angels  Resist light, blindness and poison (usually immunity).

Keep in mind that by changing forms you can potentially lose abilities that
you had in player form, because they were bound to your normal form.
Example: An ent mimic won't drown in water, but if it polymorphs into an orc,
it loses the intrinsic ability to pass water since orcs aren't made of wood.


Polymorph rings:
----------------
There are two types of polymorph rings, those which already provide a monster
form and those which can still be forged by a mimic. Latter ones are named
'Rings of Polymorphing of Player', while the first ones are named after the
monster form.

A player can use a ring that carries a monster form, by wearing it and
activating it. The user needs a mimicry skill of at least 1/2 the level of
the monster in order to activate the ring. After the form-change, if the
ring is taken off, the character will polymorph back to his normal form.

Players can also create monster rings out of 'polymorph player' rings, by
mimicking the according form, then wearing the ring and activating it.
The ring will turn into a ring of polymorphing of the current monster form.
However, to create such a ring it is required that the player has already
learnt that form. All of his knowledge will be absorbed into the ring, so
the player will completely forget the form and have to re-learn it if he
wants to use it again!

The level of the ring will change depending on the form. Here are some levels:
form level              ring level
----------------------------------
      1                     15
     30                     28
     60                     38
    100 (theoretical)       44

Polymorph rings contain a certain amount of energy that cannot be changed.
While using its form, the energy will decrease. If it reaches zero, the ring
will disintegrate and the player will polymorph back to his standard form.
If a player forges a ring, his magic device skill helps to obtain a high
amount of energy in the ring.



(6.8) Magic spells and prayers
------------------------------
Istari (mages), rangers, rogues, priests, paladins and even adventurers
can cast magic spells or speak prayers. To do so, they need the according
spell books or tomes (larger books that contain several normal books) in
their inventory.
Those books can be purchased in store '9' (the 'book store') or in '7'
(the 'black market' - very expensive but you often find tomes here!).

*Experimental* feature (can change / be removed anytime!):
Schools give certain permanent boni and abilities to the player, when trained
to a certain extent. The boni are listed below each school.

                    mind, see (0.2). It's dangerous to have the mind opened,
                    since everyone can send you any items, so better close it

    Recharge        Recharges a magic staff or wand.
    Project Spells  Makes several spells and prayers affect other players too,
                    in a radius around you that grows bigger depending on the
                    'Project Spells' level.
                    You need to cast the Project spell once! This 'turns on'
                    the area of effect for all other spells which are usable
                    on fellow players. Casting the Project spell again will
                    switch the area effect off again.
                    When you switch it on, the radius will depend on your
                    Project skill level, starting at a radius of 1 field.
                    The closer another player stands to you, the more he will
                    usually get out of the spell (eg healed HP amount,
                    duration of resistances, etc..).

                    have passed.
  BONI:             Protects the player from undead at 30, from demons at 40,

(6.9) Parties, Iron Teams, Guilds
----------------------------------
Press 'P' to display the party menu.
Here you can..

-Form a party
    In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7 character
    levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level respectively
    the same worldmap/wilderness sector. A slight experience bonus is applied
    for killing monsters in a party.
    The range is 10 levels instead of 7 for winners (queens/kings/empresses/
    emperors).
    Kings/Queens and normal players don't share experience in a party.
    'Anti-magic fields' of fellow party members have greatly reduced effect
    on spell-users in the same party, to allow the party to still be a vital
    combination.
    Set a house owner to 'party' to allow all party members to access that
    house.
    If the owner dies, the whole party is disbanded and all houses of the
    party are wiped. 
-Create an iron team
    An iron team is like a party with the following differences:
    An 'Iron Team' can only be formed with newly created characters. Its
    members will only get experience for killing monsters if ALL members
    are online and on the same dungeon level!
-Add a player to your party
    This can be done by all members of the party, not just by the owner!
-Remove a player from your party
    This can only be done by the party owner.
    Note that if you remove a player from an iron team and his character has
    already gained some experience he will be unable to join again.
    If the owner removes himself from his own party, the whole party is
    disbanded and all houses of the party are wiped.
-Leave your current party.
    Note that if you leave an iron team and your character has already gained
    experience you will be unable to join again.
    If the owner leaves his own party, the whole party is disbanded and all
    houses of the party are wiped.

-Specify player to attack
    Now you are hostile to that player and you will hurt each other like
    when fighting a monster (this includes auto-retaliating and targetting)!
-Make peace
    Make peace with a player you are hostile too. Better pay attention that
    your opponent makes peace too >:).

-Create a new guild
    This costs 2,000,000 Au. A guild will stay, even if the owner dies.
    The guild creator will receive a 'Guild Key' which designates him as the
    guild master. In case the guild master dies, another guild member may
    fetch the key to become the new guild master.
    (The guild creator used to receive Scrolls of House Creation. This has
    been removed for now, see (0.5).)
-Add player to guild
    Only the guild master or a dungeon wizard (administrator) can do this.
-Remove player from guild
    Only the guild master can do this. If all members are removed including
    the guild master, the guild ceases to exist and all houses the guild owns
    are wiped.
-Leave guild
    If the guild master leaves, the whole guild is disbanded.



(7) Tactics & strategy
======================
(7.1) Preparing the inventory for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will always want to stock up on certain
items before entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your
inventory:

Beginners (level 1)
---
+ Some Rations of Food, one or more Flask of Oil
  Know that there are traps that can empty your stomach or drain the fuel of
  your light. If you don't have supplies then you might be doomed.
+ Potion of Heroism
  because it can approximately double the hitpoints of level 1 characters
  (depending on race/class) for a short period of time as well as greatly
  improve the chance to hit the opponent, which will raise the fighting
  potential for example against enemies like Farmer Maggot's dogs. Even if
  your character has a decent amount of Hit Points, these potions raise your
  fighting abilities a good deal.
+ Potion of Cure Light Wounds
  The become useless quickly while you gain some character levels since they
  don't heal very many HP (Hit Points). At the beginning they are very helpful
  however.
+ Scroll of Phase Door
  This one does a short range teleportation, allowing you to escape if you are
  surrounded or get some distance between an enemy and yourself, allowing you
  to shoot him on distance using a ranged weapon. Since Phase Door teleports
  randomly, you might have to read several of them quickly after each other
  until you come out in a good position.
+ Maybe a scroll of Word-Of-Recall
  If read in the dungeon it will far-distance teleport you back to the town.
  This allows you to quickly "dive" deep and gain levels and find items that
  can be sold for good cash, then read Word-Of-Recall to quickly get back home
  with all the loot without having to start an annoying search for the
  staircases leading upwards back to town.

Low level character (up to 15)
---
+ Several Rations of Food, Some Flasks of Oil
+ Some Potions of Heroism
+ Some Potions of Cure Serious Wounds / Critical Wounds
  Note that Potions of Cure Critical Wounds also remove certain effects like
  blindness and confusion!
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ Some Scrolls of Word-Of-Recall
+ Some Scrolls of Identify
  These will allow you to identify unknown items that you may find!

Medium level character (up to 25)
---
+ Some Flasks of Oil. Replace rations of food with "Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger"
  These will always fully satisfy your hunger and they are not eaten by rot
  jellys ;) Lembas (elvish waybread) are also nice but very rare.
+ Many Potions of Cure Critical Wounds, maybe some Potions of Healing.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
  These potions work similar to heroism, they rise your damage output instead
  of your hit chance, allowing you to deal very extreme damage. Unfortunately
  they are quite rare. If they are used together with potions of speed the
  result can be devastating.
+ Several Scrolls of Word-Of-Recall
+ Several scrolls of Identify
  Since you will encounter the more nice (or more dangerous..) loot the deeper
  you descend, you will need a bunch of identification scrolls to find out
  what is worth being kept and which items should be thrown away.
+ Some Potions of Speed
  These will temporatily boost your global speed (movement/attack/cast) by
  +10. In case you are moving at normal speed this means that your speed is
  doubled, effectively doubling your combat power as well since you can shoot
  and hit twice as fast now. These potions also allow to quickly retreat...
+ a Staff of Teleportation
  This neat baby is your ticket out of most hazard situations where Phase Door
  wouldn't help at all. However keep in mind that staves can be destroyed. So
  if you consider a situation very dangerous and your staff of teleportation
  is suddenly burned to ashes, you should think about reading Word-Of-Recall!
  Unfortunately staves of teleportation are very expensive. Staves can be
  used even while blind or confused!
  It's not a good idea to use staves if your character isn't quite good at
  'Magic Device', press 'C' to check your character screen.
  It's a good idea to try the staff a few times in town before relying on it.
  If needed you could increase your 'Magic Device' skill, see (6.2).
+ You should have found some "Rods of Trap location"
  Keep 2 or 3 of those with you. If you encounter a pit or vault you can
  easily detect all the nasty traps inside. Rods of Door/Stair Location can
  also be helpful.
+ Especially for clearing vaults you might find a staff of light, a wand of
  trap/door destruction and maybe a wand of teleport other useful. However,
  that would be 3 more inventory slots less to pick up loot :)

Higher characters (up to 35)
---
(If you came this far, good work!)
+ Some Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger or some Lembas if you can find enough. Some
  flasks of oil if your light source needs those.
+ Lots of Potions of Cure Critical Wounds (20..40 for example), if possible
  Potions of Healing instead of cure crits.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ a Rod of Recall
  A rod cannot be destroyed by fire or acid, and you won't have to buy new
  scrolls of WOR since the rod never runs out. Further, rods of recall are not
  destroyed by traps, for example a "Trap of no return", which will burn all
  your scrolls of WOR.
+ Lots of Scrolls of Identify (up to 99!). Maybe later on a Rod of Perception.
  A rod of perception does the same thing like a scroll of identify. A rod of
  perception of quickness would be perfect. This one takes less time to
  recharge! A rod of perception of the istari..nearly godlike ;)
+ Several Potions of Speed
+ Potions of Healing
  These potions heal you way more than pots of cure critical wounds. However,
  they are extremely expensive.
+ a Staff of Teleportation
+ 2 or 3 rods of trap location. Maybe a rod of door/stair location.
+ Some Scrolls of Teleportation, maybe even fireproof.
  In case your staff is destroyed these scrolls serve as backup. If they are
  fireproof they really are a good insurance. However, you cannot read while
  blind or confused or if you stand in darkness. (Maybe someone invents
  scrolls with magically heated letters that you can read in the dark if you
  have infra-vision.. ;)
+ a "Sprig of Athelas"
  This one cures "Black Breath", which infects you if you fight a ring wraith!
  You can leave the sprig in your house since Black Breath saps your soul very
  slowly, so there should be enough time to finish business in the dungeon and
  recall to town afterwards to eat a sprig. (See 1.5 for more information
  about Black Breath.)

Very high characters (36 and above)
---
+ Satisfy Hunger or Lembas
+ Lots of Potions of Cure Critical Wounds
  If you manage to get enough Potions of Healing then you won't need pots of
  cure critical wounds anymore.
+ Potions of Healing
+ Potions of Speed
+ Potions of Berserk Strength
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ (Fireproof) Scrolls of Teleportation
+ a Staff of Teleportation (but you should really get blindness resistance in
  order to rely on Scrolls instead since they never fail.)
+ a Rod of Recall
+ 2 or 3 Rods of Trap Location. Maybe a Rod of Door/Stair Location.
+ maybe a Rod of Illumination and a Rod of Disarming or Trap/Door Destruction
  for clearing Vaults.
+ Sprigs of Athelas



(7.2) Preparing the equipment for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will need to equip certain items before
entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your equipment:

Beginners (level 1)
---
+ Lantern
  because it provides light within a radius of 2 fields instead of 1 field of
  a torch.
+ A ranged weapon as soon as possible
  Don't forget the ammunition ;)
  Try to get a sling or even better a long bow as soon as possible,
  especially if you are weak at hand-to-hand combat.
  At the beginning a ranged weapon can make all the difference and help you to
  proceed quickly. Enchant the bow to (+hit,+dam) where +dam helps a lot to
  increase the total damage you inflict on enemies, since it's multiplied by
  the bow's power factor.
+ An appropriate melee weapon
  Check out how many blows per round you get with a light "Whip (1d6)". If
  your character has only one hit per round even with light weapons, choose a
  heavy weapon that can deal more damage in one blow. If your character is low
  on strength, pay attention that you don't buy a weapon that is too heavy.

Low level character (up to 15)
---
+ Enchant the damage of your melee and/or ranged weapon a bit using "Scrolls
  of Enchant Weapon To-Dam"
+ Get some armor. Note that certain armor can decrease your dexterity or
  spellcasting abilities, partially because it is too heavy. Also some weapons
  will become less powerful if used together with a shield, and some weapons
  cannot be used at all in conjunction with a shield. A fighter should have
  approx. 30..45 AC or more.

Medium level character (up to 25)
---
+ Enchant your melee and ranged weapons to at least +8 to damage! Best would
  be (+9,+9) or maybe even (+10,+10)
  You might ask a very powerful priest or paladin to assist you, that way you
  might save a great deal of money.... (This pala/priest thing is outdated,
  sorry. However, you can ask a high level character if he/she helps you by
  taking your weapons, armour and ammunition to one of the shops that offer
  an enchantment-service. Those shops can enchant the items quite high,
  depending on the level of the customer. It's costly though.. Don't sell
  scrolls of *enchant weapon* or *enchant armour* if you find those, but use
  them to enchant your items above +9 and up to +15!)
+ A fighter should have approx. 40..70 AC or more.
+ Get "Fear Resistance" also know as "Boldness"
+ Get Free Action.
  It prevents you from being paralyzed by traps or attacks.
+ Get the 4 basic resistances, which are: Lightning/Electricity, Acid,
  Frost/Cold, Fire/Heat
+ Consider buying a small house to store backup equipment or special items
  instead of carrying them around with you.

Higher characters (up to 35)
---
+ A fighter should have approx. 65..100 AC or more.
+ Try to get a lantern of Brightness or even *Brightness*, a Dwarven Lantern
  or a Feanorian Lamp. These provide more light and/or don't need to be fueled
  and cannot be extincted. They can also have some special abilities like
  preventing you from getting overwhelmed by fear!
+ Get "See Invisible" if possible. Some very nasty monsters are invisible and
  "cold-blooded", that means they cannot be seen by infra-vision.
+ Get Poison Resistance! For example Boots of Mirkwood provide poison
  resistance. Also Elven Armors often provide it. If you are trained in the
  art of mimicry, you could try to use the form of a monster which has poison
  resistance intrinsically.
+ Try to Get Confusion Resistance
  Note that chaos resistance also provides confusion resistance.
+ Get Nexus Resistance. Nexus attacks can scramble your body, swapping your
  stats, which can be very annoying. (See 5.6.)
+ Try to get Blindness Resistance
  Helms or Caps of seeing give this!
+ Try to get Hold Life.
  This prevents your life force from being drained, making you lose experience
  and going back in character level. Cloaks of Teleri Hold Life and provide
  Free Action.
+ Get powerful ego weapons
  like Gondolins or *Defenders*. These will provide lots of resistances and
  other abilities as well as deliver extra damage to certain monsters. Even if
  they give you 1 blow less per round than your normal weapon you should
  consider these.

Very high characters (36 and above)
---
+ A fighter should have at least 90 AC. He might also have already 130 AC at
  level 36 if he is lucky.
+ Get as many high resistances as you can.. You will want Nether, Nexus,
  Disenchantment, Chaos for example.
  Note that "Feather Falling", also known as "Levitation" provides resistance
  to gravity.
+ Get "See Invisible".
+ Get items that sustain your stats, for example a Robe of Permanence.
+ Get Randarts (randomly generated artifacts) or Artifacts (predefined
  artifacts / static artifacts) as melee weapon
  You will have to fight ring wraiths. Normal weapons, even those from
  Gondolin or the most powerful *Defenders* will quickly shatter if they come
  in contact with those unbelievably corrupted creatures of terror and hate.
  (I remember one day I lost 4 Gondolins that way, pure fun..) Your only way
  to fight them is to equip an artifact since these resist ring wraiths
  greatly.
+ You will want items that permanently increase your speed!
  +10 speed or +20 speed will make you approximately twice or three times as
  fast as you usually are. Note that the curve will become flatter the higher
  your speed is, so moving at more than +40 will hardly make a difference.



(7.3) Surviving critical situations
-----------------------------------

Map structures:
---------------
There are certain situations and constellations that will occur often in a
very similar manner. Here are some of them, together with some advice how
to manage it.

- a pack of approaching monsters (here orcs), often orcs or trolls:

#########   #  #
#  ooooo#   #  #
#  ooooo#####@ # <- stand there to intercept the incoming orcish horde.
#   ooooo oo   #    As soon as three or four of them stand on adjacent fields
#        o     #    move up one field to limit the attackers to 3 at a time.
#############  #    Sometimes the AI is very smart and monsters will try to
            #  #    surround you anyways. Phase door scrolls will help.

-sometimes packs of monsters, usually animals, retreat if you chase them in
 hallways, and will only attack if you enter a room. If these monsters don't
 have ranged attacks, just take them out with a bow or another range weapon.
 If you decide to chase them to the next room make sure you have enough phase
 door scrolls and healing pots to win a fight where you are attacked from all
 sides at once.

-the range of your missile weapon (bow) is often greater than monsters' range
 of sight as well as your own range of sight, allowing you to take out some
 monsters by shooting into the dark.

-If you open a door, especially doors to pits with unknown content, be very
 careful and open the door diagonally to have as little creatures as possible
 see you from inside the pit. If you open the door to a so-called "jelly pit"
 (contains icky-things, jellies, mold, mushroom patches) or a "water pit"
 (containing water ball/bolt shooting monsters) you might be insta-killed
 otherwise. Here is how to open the door:

###########
#,jmmjj,ii#@ <- stand here and open diagonally
#j,m,,mijm+  <- don't stand here or more monsters will see you from inside
###########

Prepare to close the door again as quickly as possible, it might be needed. In
general you should leave water pits and especially jelly pits alone!
Coin pits (lots of '$' inside) can also contain very powerful mimics!

-If you fight monsters that can cast ball spells or breathe on you, be aware
 that they might target a field adjacent to you and hence still hit you even
 if they cannot target you directly!

-pack monsters can be very nasty if they can shoot or cast spells from behind.
 In that case you should make sure that only very few of them can see you at a
 time. If your health suddenly drops, teleport away at once.

-Sometimes it might be a good idea to use a "Stone-to-mud" or "Trap/Door
 destruction" spell to open a door from a distance.

-For weaker characters it might be a good idea to stay around 1000..1500 ft
 and try to get enough stat potions (potions that raise your six primary
 stats, STR INT WIS DEX CON CHR) until they have a considerably high amount
 of hit points and/or combat potential before they dive deeper!


Some monsters that people often get killed by are:
--------------------------------------------------
-At very low levels there are especially 2 death causes:
 a) Pack monsters that have ranged attacks and fire at you all at once. See
    the map structures section above.
 b) Monsters that are simply a little bit faster than you so you can't run
    away if you decide that you can't beat them.
    See (7.1) and (7.2) how to equip yourself to minimize risks.

-If you recognize that you cannot win a fight and it will likely end deadly
 it might be a good idea to read a scroll of word-of-recall as early as
 possible and then try to survive until it kicks in and carries you to safety.

-Druid monsters, for example druid snotlings or druid kobolds. They can appear
 at very low level and they are able to cast firebolts that insta-kill you
 (instantly kill you).

-Elite Uruks, they fire extremely sharp arrows, always posing a high threat.

-Chieftain/Warrior/Monk/Unbeliever monsters of any kind. You will often see
 someone being killed by a hill troll monk or forest troll chieftain for
 example.. Prepare to hit your phase door macro if you spot a shimmering
 extraordinarily fast moving monster within a potentially dangerous mob.

-Veteran archer/Master archer monsters of any kind can pose a very high
 threat. Better get reflection ability if you are planning to fight these in
 a ranged duel.

-Hounds with breaths that need a high resistance or that cannot be resisted at
 all. For example..
 At lower levels: Air hounds, Nexus hounds, Vibration hounds, Impact hounds,
                  Inertia hounds, Aquatic & Water hounds (avoid aquatic &
                  water hounds especially; the others still give very good
                  experience at a reasonable danger exposure.)
 At higher levels: Plasma hounds, Gravity hounds, Time hounds, Aether hounds,
                   Hounds of Tindalos (beware of Gravity & Time hounds
                   especially).

-Dark elven Warlocks. These belong to the few monsters that can cast mana
 bolts, which inflict very high damage. Even worse, DEW (Dark Elven Warlocks)
 can appear in packs. Beware!

-Colbrans. These are the lowest monsters that can "reflect". This means that
 missiles or magical bolt spells will be reflected onto the caster, which can
 insta-kill weak wizards that use hi-damage spells. (Note: Monster reflection
 was removed a while ago, so you don't have to worry about this one for now.)

-Will o' the wisps are very hard to spot and catch, their curses are
 devastating.

-The Glass Golem drives everyone insane whom it manages to hit, high AC helps.

-Drolems. A constructed dragon that will breathe poison for high damage and
 takes a lot of hits before ceasing to function.

-The Stormbringer, an animated blade that bears mad fury within. It swings
 so powerful that it can knockout its enemies with ease. Defeating it,
 however, will make it usable to its defeater!

The most powerful representant of each class:
-Ranger chieftains are tough opponents who can nail you on the spot and
 use magic attacks as well as summon.
-Knight Templars, powerful paladins who are immune to holy attacks and
 are even able to call an angel for support.
-Patriarchs, these unfaltering priestlords can summon and curse rapidly.
-Master Mindcrafters, their ability to summon mighty support and to smash
 your brain by psi attacks is feared.
-Old sorcerors are able to summon ancient dragonkind and wyrms, beware!
-(Grand) Swordsmasters, most skilled swordsmen that will disarm you easily.
-(Grand) Master mystics, most powerful martial artists. With their special
 techniques they can manage to stun you easily. Best remedy is high AC so
 they won't hit you in the first place. Alternatively you can quaff potions
 to remove any stun effect.
-(Grand) Master thieves, very fast and stealthy they steal your possessions!

-Unique enemies. If you see a monster blinking in different colours, before
 trying to kill it you should examine the text file "r_info.txt" located in
 the lib\game directory to find out if it is a certain unique enemy. Then look
 up his abilities and make sure you are prepared to fight him.
 (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)

-If you see an enemy that you don't know anything about and that could pose a
 threat (especially if it's inside a vault!), STAY AWAY and consult either an
 experienced player or look into the file r_info.txt in your tomenet/lib/game
 directory to find out what the opponent is capable of. The safest (and most
 boring and least rewarding) way to play is to avoid vaults! Vaults can
 contain an enemy against against whom you don't have the slightest chance of
 winning.

-The most powerful monsters of the daemon realm, the dragonkind and the
 heavenly planes, namely Star-spawns of Cthulu, Great Wyrms of Power,
 balance keepers of the skies, sun and stars (Blades), Nether Realm guards.

-Blinking 'A' (unique angels) or 'U' (powerful or unique demons) as well as
 bright coloured 'U' (greater demons) and blinking 'W' (zephyr lords or
 Nazgul) always pose a high threat. While Zephyr lords aren't that strong on
 their own they are able to summon packs of hounds which can mean a swift doom
 if those have dangerous breathing attacks.
 Some other dangerous demons are..
 Servitors of the outer gods, Lords of Change, Greater Balrogs,
 Bloodthirsters, Pit Fiends, Great Unclean Ones, Keepers of Secrets.

-High undead can also pose a high threat and are responsible for many a death,
 those are Nightwalkers, Nightcrawlers, Nightwings and their likes.

-Nazgul have quite some chance to destroy your melee weapon if you hit them!
 In case your melee weapon isn't your main way of fighting you could inscribe
 it @Ox before fighting a Nazgul to avoid auto-retaliation and then use
 spells or whatever to destroy it. If you rely on melee weapons get an
 artifact since these resist Nazgul greatly!
 Dark Swords and ego weapons also have a certain chance to resist destruction.
 (Compare (1.5).)

-Unique 'P' are often very dangerous, some say the most dangerous next to
 Morgoth himself is Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss.


Mistakes / Carelessness:
------------------------
-Further, players are often killed if they lack resistances and/or free action
 (against paralyzation) but nevertheless dive down into the dungeon very
 quickly.

-Teleport out of trouble
 If you are not an antimagic-user, you should buy a staff of teleportation as
 soon as possible since it can take you out of dangerous situations.
 However, the staff is no guarantee :)
 After you bought it, try if you can actually use it well or if you keep
 failing! If you're not good at magic devices you might have to spend points
 into your 'Magic Device' skill.
 I recommend to always have at least 3 charges in the staff before diving into
 the dungeon.

-Quaff potions of cure critical wounds or healing if you get (heavily) stunned
 to prevent a lethal knockout in the next round! Further you can't use martial
 arts special techniques while stunned, cutting your damage a lot.
 Get sound resistance to not waste potions to cure stun effects from
 water/sound/gravity/ice/plasma attacks.

-Don't wait till you are a '1' or '0' before you try to teleport out.
 If you want to be on the safe side, teleport out when you are a '4' or '3'.
 Remember that your teleport staff may fail sometimes or that enemies may
 stun you for several turns!

-Before AND after a larger fight, check your inventory if you can carry on
 or if you have to return to town to stock up. A common problem is that some
 monsters can empty or burn up your teleport items, which you might overlook.

-If you are surrounded by huge piles of loot from dead monsters you might be
 tempted to drop cheaper items like phase door scrolls to make room for the
 precious loot, and go /afk to wait for pseudo-id. However, know that you
 _can_ all of a sudden be ambushed during that time by enemies. By enemies
 that _require_ you to use phase door..

-I do not recommend to drop food nor oil in exchange for loot if you're not
 planning to recall instantly after you picked up the loot.

-Learn from your mistakes. If you die, think about if you were taking too high
 a risk, and check if you overlooked anything, maybe you were missing
 essential items (cure critical w. potions to get rid of confusion/blindness).
 Next time, be more careful. Playing TomeNET means learning a lot about the
 monsters/items.


Teamplay:
---------
-Team up with fellow players that are approximately at your character level.
 This means more fun and less danger. Your teammates can save your life and
 support you with helpful spells, items and knowledge.
 A player in a party gets a share of experience points from the kills of other
 party members if they are within 7 levels to the player.
 For winners (queens/kings/empresses/emperors) the range is 10 levels.

-Good combinations are the classical meat shields / damage dealers /
 supporters. Keep your teammates in mind and don't teleport out if it meant
 certain death to them while you could still take some hits.



(7.4) Spoiler files
-------------------
In the folder tomenet-bin/lib/game you find several data files containing
various information about all monsters, items and other features of TomeNET.
These files are named X_info.txt and can be read via a normal text editor.
The most important files are:
r_info.txt  contains all monsters.
k_info.txt  contains all base item types.
e_info.txt  contains all ego item types.
a_info.txt  contains all artifacts.
All files contain a block of information, either at the beginning or at the
end, which explains the meaning of each discrete info-line.



(7.5) Skill point distribution
------------------------------
Melee fighters should maximize (to get extra attacks and extra damage) one of
the weapon masteries (Sword, Hafted, Polearm, Axes) or Martial Arts if they
prefer this, and 'Interception'!
Interception is especially important if they don't train Martial Arts, in
order to prevent the target from summoning or casting spells.
Hybrid classes might choose to not fully train their chosen mastery to have
spare skill points for spell casting or other skills.

Spellcasters might want to train Spell-Power additionally to their school
spells to further boost their powers.

Archers probably want to train Calmness to keep shooting adjacent enemies,
without getting interrupted by them. And of course they should train one of
the ranged-weapon masteries (Bows, Crossbows, Slings) to eventually get 3
extra shots per round, and also train Archery up to 50 to get additional
extra might.

Spare skill points might be well invested into Stealth and Sneakiness,
especially in Stealth if your stealth is rather low.



(8) Miscellanous
================
(8.1) 'The Art Not To Die'
--------------------------
You died. Hm, very annoying indeed. If you are a "No-ghost" or "Hellish"
character, then you are wiped out now. Otherwise you became a ghost on the
same dungeon level as you died on. Your items are scattered on the floor, now
what to do? The items will disappear forever if you leave that dungeon level
and noone remains down there to "keep it static" or "hold the level", as the
technical term are. If you think you really need the items, ask someone to get
down on your dungeon level and either revive you there using a scroll of life
or pick up your items and give them back to you in the town.
If your level is still very low, you can just decide to suicide and start
over. That is sometimes easier. 
In TomeNET you will often encounter new situations that can lead to death. The
most important thing here is that you really keep in mind your mistakes of the
past to prevent them from happening again. A key to winning is a firm
knowledge of the monsters that you encounter, so you will be able to decide if
you should attack or flee.
In my opinion playing TomeNET can be called "the art not to die".



(8.2) Character Dumps
---------------------
You should send in character dumps, if you have reached an intermediate level,
to http://angband.oook.cz/ ! You can create a character dump by invoking the
character screen by pressing 'C' and then pressing 'f' (as it states at the
bottom). These dumps are always interesting to see. Your character doesn't need
to have achieved a high level for sending in a dump. Every level is fine.
Character dumps are automatically created in your /tomenet-bin/lib/user folder
if your character dies. The filename is charactername-death.txt, for example
Gandalf-death.txt. (no overwrite-check is performed.)



(8.3) Golem creation
---------------------
Players can create golems, mindless animated humanoids that will fight for
them. Monsters won't attack golems, but the controlling players. To create a
golem, you will need these parts:

A 'scroll of Golem Creation'
A massive piece of a specific material
Arms, up to 4.
Legs, at least 2, can be up to 30 (a centipede-style golem!)

To control the golem, you will need 3 controlling scrolls. These won't be
read, but activated! On activation ('A') they toggle the golem's behaviour.
The scrolls are:

A 'Golem Scroll of Guard'
A 'Golem Scroll of Following'
A 'Golem Scroll of Attack'

If you have gathered all these items in your inventory, read the scroll of
golem creation! The golem will only listen to commands of a scroll which
was in your inventory when you read the scroll of golem creation, so make
sure you carry all 3 controlling scrolls before creating it.

Each arm will inflict (x)d(3 + arm value) damage on a target.
The arm value is displayed in brackets, part of the item name.
The 'x' are listed in the materials table below.
Example: A 'Golem Arm (+8)' of an 'Iron Golem' will do 9d(3+8) damage, so
9d11, which means the damage per hit varies randomly from 9 up to 99.
Each leg will increase the golem's speed by the number displayed on the leg.
A golem with 30 legs can be *FAST*, but keep in mind that more than 40..50
speed won't do much of a difference since speed effect in general decreases at
very high values.

The material determines armour class, hit points and the damage dice count of
the golem. Materials are:
    Wood             20 AC,  10d10 hit dice,  3 damage dice.
    Copper           40 AC,  10d20 hit dice,  6 damage dice.
    Iron             70 AC,  10d40 hit dice,  9 damage dice.
    Aluminium        90 AC,  10d60 hit dice, 12 damage dice.
    Silver          100 AC,  10d70 hit dice, 15 damage dice.
    Gold            130 AC,  10d80 hit dice, 18 damage dice.
    Mithril         160 AC, 10d100 hit dice, 21 damage dice.
    Adamantite      210 AC, 10d150 hit dice, 24 damage dice.
Some rumours say that the highest materials can only be found on even deeper
dungeons than where Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness resides.

If the creator inscribes items in his inventory with '@G' and then creates a
golem, those items will be transferred to the golem (careful, they cannot be 
retrieved!) and fuse with it, bestowing it with their abilities.
The following rules are applied:
-An item 'of life (+x)' increases the hit dice number by x.
-An item that raises the player's speed by x speeds the golem up by 2 / 3 * x.
-An item that improves the player's tunneling ability bestows the KILL_WALL
ability upon the golem.
-An item that gives fire or acid resitance will make the golem immune(!) to
fire or acid.
-An item that gives nether or nexus or disenchantment resistance will give
the according resistance to the golem.
All other items/abilities have no effect.

Golems can't be detected by ESP, they regenerate quickly, they are powerful
and can push past weaker monsters, they can bash doors. They can dig through
rock, they are immune to cold, electricity and poison, they don't know fear
and can neither be confused nor paralyzed. They are immune to teleportation
attacks. Golems have always the maximum possible hit dice. Further, golems
count as '100 %clones', hence giving no experience if someone kills them.
Golems always attack by hitting with their arms for raw physical damage.
A golem has the same level as its owner had at the time of creation.
Golem owners don't get experience for monsters killed by the golem.

If the scroll of attack is toggled, the golem will attack its master's current
target.
If the scroll of guard is toggled, the golem will start attacking the monster
with the most HP on its adjacent fields (those are the 8 fields around it;
if those are empty, it just waits).
If the scroll of following is toggled, the golem will just follow its master.
If a scroll is read although the according state is already active, the golem
will stop doing that.

Last but not least, the golem is..
-following you on staircases up/downwards.
-transported with you by word of recall.
-not transported by normal teleportation.
-saved if you exit the game.
-the golem will never attack other players unless you set them to hostile via
the party menu ('P'). If they are hostile, the same rules as for monsters
apply (see the description of the 3 command scrolls above).



(8.4) Artifact creation
-----------------------
"Scrolls of Artifact Creation" count to the most wanted items in the game
because of their power to turn a normal piece of equipment into a powerful
random artifact. Often kings and queens look out for these since they are
unable to use static artifacts, so they depend on rand-arts.
The scrolls are very rarely found; occasions to buy one are fair in the
expensive black market, but also the normal BM may sometimes offer some.
It doesn't matter where you are when you read the scroll, the resulting
artifact's power is always determined randomly.

Here is some advice how to use these most valuable scrolls wisely:

DOESN'T ENCHANT WHOLE STACKS:
-Don't use scrolls of artifact creation on item stacks, it would
reduce the stack to 1.

ONLY WORKS ON STANDARD EQUIPMENT:
-Artifact creation only works on items that can be equipped - with the
exception of tool items like diggers, picklock, money belt, device of theft
prevention, tarpaulin, flint, mummy wrapping, climbing set. These won't work!

DOESN'T WORK ON EGOS / ARTS:
-Don't use them on ego items or artifacts, or you will lose the scroll!
If you use it on items with a discount, the artifact will get it too.
Watch out: 'Indestructible' and 'Cursed' rings are ego items too, so are
'Amulets of Telepathic Awareness', 'Rings of Polymorphing' and
Dragon Scale Mails 'of Defense'!

HOW IT WORKS ON JEWELRY:
-In general, it's not always a good idea to try to turn a ring or amulet that
has high bonus numbers into an artifact, like for example a ring of speed
(+11) because these numbers will get erased and randomly re-rolled.
On jewelry (+to-hit,+to-dam) and [+AC] will stay the same (for example a ring
of slaying (+10,+15) will keep the (+10,+15)).
(Any dice (xdy) as well as _base_ AC [x,+0] on jewelry will always become 0.)

HOW IT WORKS ON NON-JEWELRY:
All boni, to-hit/to-dam/to-ac and the pval/bpval (those (+x) bonus) are
randomly rerolled. So it won't matter what stats the item has, only its
base type is important.

Mods on the final randart:
--------------------------
The item will gain a random number of random properties. The more powerful it
becomes, the higher a chance of also becoming 'aggravating' will be.

There is always a 10% chance that the resulting randart will be 'cursed'.
Cursed randarts cannot be sold to shops even if the curse is broken. They gain
only very few abilities, which are accompanied by different types of curses.

Possible mods that randarts may get depend on its base type.
Further, there are general mods that may appear on all items regardless of its
type. For each applied mod there is a chance of 50% to be picked from either
type-dependant mods or general mods.
Ammunition (shots/pebbles, arrows, bolts) will never get general mods but only
type-dependant ones.
Boomerangs, bows, crossbows and slings usually get more type-dependant mods
than general mods.

Type-dependant mods:
--------------------
Bows, crossbows, slings
        Extra shots
        Extra might
        +hit bonus
        +dam bonus
Weapons
        Blessed (usable for priests without penalty)
        Hit point bonus (+LIFE)   (*)

        Acid/elec/fire/cold brands
        Increased damage dice
        All SLAY mods (also have a chance to add the corresponding ESP)
        All KILL (*SLAY*) mods (will also add the corresponding ESP)
        See invisible
        Extra attacks
        Extra +hit and +dam bonus
        Extra +AC bonus
        Critical hit bonus
        Vampiric life leech
        Reduced weight
Mage staves
        Sustain wisdom
        Sustain intelligence
        See invisible
        Random ESP

        All elemental brands (acid/elec/fire/cold/poison)
        All SLAY mods
        All KILL (*SLAY*) mods
        Vampiric life leech
        Exploding property. The type of explosion damage is randomly picked
                            from this list:

Technical stuff (no need to read this, basically :)-
More details about how randart creation works internally:
First, a 'target power' is chosen randomly, usually in the range from 40..120.
Then, TomeNET tries several times to generate a randart that approximately
fits into that target power. To do this, after a randart is randomly created,
all its abilities are checked and calculated into a single number, the
'artifact_power'. If this approximately matches the 'target power', the
randart is finally created. If the numbers differ a lot, the randart is erased
and randomly recreated until its powers are fitting. The higher the target
power is, the more likely the randart will be 'aggravating nearby creatures'.



(8.5) Troubleshooting
---------------------
PROBLEM 01: I don't get to see a server list when I start TomeNET.
            Instead, I am immediately asked for account and password.
SOLUTION:   This is a typical problem on Windows XP. There are 3
            possible fixes:
            -Use 'Win98 Compatibility Mode' (Create a link from tomenet4.exe,
             right-click it, choose 'properties', choose 'Compatibility'.
             This option is available natively on Windows XP systems; for
             Windows 2000 systems first try the other two points mentioned
             below, if they don't help, get the compatibility mode update
             from www.microsoft.com or from www.c-blue.de/appupd.exe ).
            -Move the 'tomenet-bin' directory to your drive's root. For
             example C:\tomenet-bin\.. .
            -to edit your "tomenet4.ini" file and specify a host directly by
             specifying "HOST=europe.tomenet.net".
             Or you can even give the IP address "HOST=62.210.141.11".

PROBLEM 02: I get to a server list, but it doesn't show any servers. It just
            says 'Press Q to enter a server manually' and that's it.
SOLUTION:   There are 2 possible solutions.
            -There is currently no public TomeNET server running. That can
             happen if a server update is currently being applied or if for
             some reason the server just crashed. Try again after a minute.
            -There are some DNS problems. These can happen for various reasons
             although they aren't very likely. DNS problems can last for a
             longer period of time though, being very annoying.
             That the server isn't listed doesn't mean that it's down though.
             You should try to connect manually (press 'Q') to either:
             europe.tomenet.net
             or (if that doesn't work either) directly to its IP adress:
             62.210.141.11

PROBLEM 03: All windows except for the main window stay empty. (occurs on
            Windows XP machines).
SOLUTION:   Open tomenet4.ini file with a text editor, look for the window
            sections, change the fonts to the same settings (8x13) as in the
            [Main window] section: FontFile=8X13.FON , Font=8X13.FON .
            Also, you could adjust the width/height of the windows (to 80x24
            for example). Try other fonts too, maybe they work for you.

PROBLEM 04: I cannot browse (some) spell books, I see some LUA error messages
            if I try or when I connect to the server.
SOLUTION:   Your LUA script files are outdated. Those files are responsible
            for any spell-casting and some other things.
            To update them, you have 2 possibilities:
            -Automatic update: Join the server, you should see a message in
             the chat window, saying that (some of) your LUA files are being
             updated. After all files have been successfully received (a
             green message will say so for each file) you need to exit and
             re-enter the server in order for them to take effect.
            -The first method doesn't work for everyone. Another possibility
             is to just download a ZIP file containing the latest scripts
             and extract it to your /tomenet-bin/lib/scpt folder.
             You can get the latest scripts at www.c-blue.de/rogue.html .

PROBLEM 05: When I start TomeNET I don't see anything except a small hollow
            yellow rectangle (the cursor). All windows stay black. It seems
            that the cursor reacts to my inputs by printing out some black
            hence invisible text.
SOLUTION:   A rare problem that is not caused by TomeNET really. Restart your
            MS Windows system and the text should be visible again.

PROBLEM 06: TomeNET seems to freeze up while playing.
SOLUTION:   This can happen if your latency is relatively high and many
            messages are transported between the server and your client.
            In fact it's just your display that freezes up. In that state
            you can for example type a chat message and other players
            will read it.
            Quit the game and join again to continue playing.
            Or just start another instance of the game and log in, that will
            override the old connection, making your client quit with
            "resume connection" message.

PROBLEM 07: I am disconnected during gameplay.
SOLUTION:   This can have several reasons. On disconnection a message box will
            appear, telling you about the problem. The following messages
            might occur:
            "client quit"
                    This just shows up if you regularly quit your client.
            "Committed suicide"
                    You just committed suicide..
            "resume conneection"
                    This happens if you try to log in the same character with
                    two TomeNET clients at once, the older client will quit
                    and the client that just logged in will take over.
            "Killed by..."
                    Your character was finally killed/destroyed.
            "Starving to death"
                    You died to starvation.
            "Timeout 08"
                    This happens if you 'lag out' on a slow connection or if
                    the server or your computer is under very heavy load.
            "Panic save failed"
                    This means the server just crashed and even failed to save
                    the characters :(. It will usually be back online after a
                    minute or earlier.
            "Panic save succeded"
                    This means the server just crashed :(. It will usually
                    be back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save succeeded)"
                    The server was shut down regularly. It will usually be
                    back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save failed!)"
                    The server was shut down regularly but saving the
                    characters failed for some reason (insufficient disk
                    space). It will usually be back online after a minute or
                    earlier.
            "banned for ..."
                    You were banned temporarily from the server (includes
                    being kicked out).
            "kicked out"
                    You were kicked out of the server.
            "read error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "write error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "flush error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "receive error in play"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.

PROBLEM 08: I am disconnected from the server with an error message, this
            happens before I can even start playing.
SOLUTION:   Read the error message displayed in a message box on quitting.
            Here is a list of possible errors and solutions:
            "Your name is too long!"
                    Don't use names longer than 15 characters.
            "Your name contains control chars!"
                    Don't use control chars in your name.
            "No such character"
                    Your client tried to log in with a
                    non-existant character (shouldn't happen).
            "You are temporarily banned"
                    Self-explaining.
            "disconnect in login"
                    Don't take too long for your character
                    creation or you might time out.
            "login failure"
                    A wrong account or password was entered.
            "Name already owned"
                    Account name already exists.
            "Your client is outdated"
                    Download the latest client, see (0.1).
            "Server responds 'Unknown client version'"
                    The server might be running an older
                    version than your client is.
            "Sorry, the game is full."
                    Wow the game is really full!
            "That nickname is already in use."
                    Choose a different character name.
            "The server didn't like your nickname, realname or hostname"
            (or just "Net input error")
                    Player characters are identified by 3 names:
                    -Nickname (character's name)
                    -Realname (account name)
                    -Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
                    The hostname is not really important. However, make sure
                    that all of these 3 names may only consist of letters,
                    numbers, spaces, and all other characters with an ASCII
                    code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
                    The realname and hostname must not be empty. The nickname
                    (character name) needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z'
                    or 'a'..'z').
            "There is already another character from this user/machine.."
                    You tried to login with two characters from the same
                    account or machine simultaneously, which is usually
                    forbidden.
            "Sorry, the server is for members only."
                    Log in with 'guest'. You need to get an account for this
                    private server in order to play. 
            If you get kicked out with an error message on the character
            overview screen (which seems to be empty), also see PROBLEM 14.

PROBLEM 09: I can't connect to the meta-server (the server that displays you
            a list of online TomeNET servers) or a specific TomeNET server.
            Instead my connection seems to time-out.
SOLUTION:   If you are behind a firewall make sure that the TCP ports
            8801 for metaserver and 18348 for the actual TomeNET server aren't
            blocked. (Well, the metaserver isn't needed to play - specify the
            game server via command-line or when asked for it after starting
            up the game then.)

PROBLEM 10: I'm not blocked by a firewall, but I still don't see the
            metaserver when I run Tomenet. Instead after waiting for a short
            period of time I'm asked to enter a server manually.
SOLUTION:   The meta-server might be down or a DNS problem might be occuring
            right now. This can happen from time to time. You don't need the
            meta-server to play TomeNET though.
            Just type in the hostname of the server you'd like to connect to,
            for europe enter:   europe.tomenet.net
            If the hostname doesn't work you can also try entering its IP
            adress 62.210.141.11.
            Make sure your tomenet4.ini file contains the correct server port,
            usually 18348! This port isn't needed if you use the meta-list to
            choose a server to connect to, but it's important if you connect
            directly!
            You can connect directly to a TomeNET server and skip the meta
            server list by running your Tomenet directly from the command-line
            (DOS window) within its folder, adding the server IP as a
            parameter. (In windows2k choose START/Run... and type 'cmd'
            without quotation marks to open a command-line window.
            Alternatively you can create a shortcut from your tomenet4.exe by
            right-clicking, dragging, releasing it. Edit this shortcut's
            properties and add the server IP to the command-line.)
            For europe server it would look like this:
            tomenet4.exe europe.tomenet.net
            If the hostname doesn't work for whatever reason you may try the
            IP adress:
            tomenet4.exe 62.210.141.11

PROBLEM 11: The main window doesn't display the floor dots in certain
            dungeons, like the Training Tower and Angband. Further, fields
            are sometimes not redrawn correctly, resulting in fake 'trails'.
SOLUTION:   Seems to happen on Windows XP machines sometimes.
            Workaround (will slightly change the game's look):
            Edit /lib/user/font-win.prf and comment out the lines which end on
            the string '\31' (should be 2 lines at the beginning of the file,
            those labelled 'Floors' and 'Invis Traps').

PROBLEM 12: Every time I connect to the server it will automatically download
            LUA script files. However, they will have a size of 0 Bytes.
SOLUTION:   Currently not resolved problem. Workaround: Make sure you really
            have the latest LUA files in /pm/lib/scpt (you can download them
            from http://www.c-blue.de/rogue.html). Then set all LUA files in
            that directory to write-protected. This will prevent TomeNET from
            overwriting them with 0 Byte files.

PROBLEM 13: I seem to be able to login, create a new character or select a
            character, and see the message of the day (login screen).
            But right before the actual game starts I get a broken pipe / no
            packet reply error.
SOLUTION:   This might be caused by a misconfigured router (some D-Link models
            for example). Try to establish an SSH-tunnel from your PC behind
            the router to a machine outside of your LAN for port 18348.
            (This might even reduce lag under certain circumstances.)

PROBLEM 14: I get kicked out with an error message after entering an account
            name and password.
SOLUTION:   It's most likely because that account name is already in use by
            someone else so your password was recognized as 'incorrect' since
            it was most likely different from that user's password. Just try a
            different account name.
            Likewise, if that account indeed belongs to you, you have probably
            made a typo while entering your password.

PROBLEM 15: The level completely changed while I was on it.
SOLUTION:   No real solution at this time, sorry. See (0.5) for more
            information about that problem. ('types of crashes')

PROBLEM 16: I cannot see monster x although I can 'See Invisible'.
SOLUTION:   Some monsters have no appeareance and cannot be seen at all.
