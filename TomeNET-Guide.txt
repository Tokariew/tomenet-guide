(0) Quickstart
==============
(0.1) Start & play
------------------
-Get the latest client from www.tomenet.net or www.c-blue.de/rogue.html .
-Extract it, run tomenet4.exe.
-Choose a server from the meta list that appears on your screen.
-Create a character, half-troll warrior is good for beginners.
Good stats order for it is STR,CON,DEX,WIS,INT,CHR
Make sure you choose (n)ormal mode. Not 'fruit bat' or something.
Now you're in the game and should see the town (Bree) :)
-To chat, press the colon key ':' . Don't hesitate to ask other players
if you have any problems with getting started.
-To run, press SHIFT+<direction key> where direction keys are on
the number pad 7,8,9, 4,6, 1,2,3. Running often requires that
numlock is turned off (press the 'num' key so the green light is off).
If SHIFT+<direction> doesn't work on your system, you can press the dot '.'
followed by a direction key.
-You can wear/wield your armour/weapons by pressing 'w' and choosing them
from your inventory which is displayed in the window labeled Recall'.
-You can pick up items if you stand on them and press 'g'.
-You can enter stairs down/upwards by standing on them and pressing the
corresponding key '<' or '>'.
-Nearby the town there's often a 'newbie tower' which is a good place
to start because if you die there nothing will happen except a slight
loss of experience. Ask people where the '<' (tower entrance) is found.
-If you die outside of the newbie tower you will usually turn into a ghost.
This ghost cant wear any items, so it's a good idea to care about being
revived. To get revived, either visit the temple in town (it's a green '4')
or ask another player to read a Scroll Of Life while standing next to you.
While you're a ghost you can freely float up/down by pressing '<' and '>'.
-Press '?' to get an in-game help about keys and commands.
-If you have any journals like 'Guide to Middle Earth' or 'The Gazette' in
your inventory (Recall window) you should read those by pressing 'r' to read.
-If your character gains a new level it also gains skill points. To distribute
those, invoke the skill screen with 'G'.



(0.2) Command reference & key sets
----------------------------------
Can be different depending on OS / configuration.

Keys:
The first key is of the 'original Angband key set', the second key is of the
'rogue-like' key set. Some people prefer to use that one. You can change it
in the options menu, which you invoke with '=' key.


Directions:
    Original key set        Rogue-like key set      Rogue-like (running)
        7   8   9               y   k   u               Y   K   U
        4   5   6               h       l               H       L
        1   2   3               b   j   n               B   J   N

You can also use the arrow keys for movement.
Pressing '5' will cause you to spend a turn with doing nothing.


i       i       display your inventory.
e       e       display your equipment.
I       I       inspects an item, showing its special abilities in case it
                has some. To examine an item you must either have bought it
                from a shop or *identified* it. Mages can learn *ID* spell
                "Greater Identify", some shops offer *ID* service, or you can
                use a scroll of *identify*. If the item hasn't been
                *identified* yet, you will only see basic information.
                If you examine weapons, it always tells you the weapon class
                (sword/hafted/axe/polearm) as well as if it's 1-, 2- or
                1,5-handed.
w       w       wear/wield an item from your inventory (weapons, armour,
                ammunition, tools, rings, amulets, etc).
t       T       take off items.
q       q       quaff a potion.
r       r       read a scroll.
E       E       eat. (Thunderlords, also known as Dragonriders, can eat
                firestones to gain temporary special abilities, see (5.9) .)
F       F       fuel your light source.
f       t       fire.
v       v       throw.
b       (P)     browse (peruse) a book.
m       m       activate a skill (ie cast a magic spell or use an ability).
a       z       use (aim) a magic wand.
z       a       use (zap) a magic rod.
u       Z       use a magic staff.
g       g       pick up an item from the floor. You have to stand on the item
                to do that. You can also pick up an item by pressing '5' on
                the number pad while numlock is turned off. Gold is always
                picked up automatically.
C       C       see a character overview.
L,M     W,M     navigate on the map (use direction keys if using L).
s       s       search adjacent fields, objects or walls for hidden traps or
                doors.
S       #       enter 'search mode'. You will search your adjacent fields once
                each turn. If you stand next to a room and you want to find
                its hidden door, turn this on and run along its walls until
                you find it.
A       A       activate an item. Usually an artifact, a dragon scale mail or
                a ring of polymorphing (shapechanging).
T,+     CTRL+T  tunnel through an obstacle or a wall.
R       R       rest. Your hit points and mana will regenerate faster while
                resting.
o       o       open something.
c       c       close something.
d       d       drop an item.

D       D       disarm a trap.
k       CTRL+D  destroy an item.
G       G       skills screen.
B       f       bash/force something (ie a stuck door).
l       x       look at a player/monster/object (use direction keys for
                targetting).
j               steal from monsters/players (pvp-stealing is not recommended).
U       O       use undead powers (use this if you died and became a ghost).
                Using these will drain your experience. If you ran out of
                experience points, your ghost fades away (= you character will
                be completely erased).
CTRL+S          spike a door (using iron spikes, the door will be jammed).

h               buy/sell a house or change house parameters. See (4.10).
P               party screen. Form/disband/modify a party with other players
                here. In a party you will share experience points if you are
                within 7 character levels to each other and on the same
                dungeon/tower level respectively the same worldmap/wildernis
                sector. See (6.9) for details.

/       in general use an item (combines q,r, etc..).
~       display further information of your character.
        Point (3) here is especially helpful for mimics:
        The number shown in round brackets before each monster name is the
        number they have to enter for their 'Polymorph self into..' ability!
X       quickly swap between two equippable items. They must be inscribed
        @1@0 and @2@0.
{       inscribe an item.
}       remove inscription from an item.
_       drink from a fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
        Fountains can have good/bad/no effects.
%       edit your macros.
=       edit your preferences. (Contains many obsolete effectless entries.)
        Most important entries here are..
        User Interface Options:
            "Rogue-like commands" will change your keyboard layout to
                the original Rogue key definitions.
        Disturbance Options:
            Note that most of these aren't available in multi-player and
            will be set server-side, so players can't change them.
        Game-Play Options:
            "Set 'AFK' mode automatically" will set you afk after some
                minutes of inactivity.
            "Flicker messages in recall" will allow you to see animated
                messages in the 'recall' window (message history).
        Efficiency Options:
            Mostly moved to server-side, hence obsolete.
        TomeNET Options:
            "Automatically open doors" makes your character try to open a door
                just by moving towards it.
            "Automatically disarm traps" makes your character try to disarm a
                trap just by stepping onto it.
            "Automatically tunnel walls" makes your character tunnel through a
                wall just by moving towards it.
            "Scroll the screen more frequently" helps to avoid death by
                attacks that came from off-screen. However, this option can be
                a bit irritating.
            "Always show lists in item/skill selection" will always show a
                list of possible choices if you use commands that require you
                to make a selection from a list of choices.
:       type a chat message. To whisper privately, enter <player>:<text>
        You can also enter a slash command here.
        For details about chat, see (2.3).
        For details about slash commands, see further below in this paragraph.
@       displays a list of players currently on the server.
'       lets you peek at the equipment of party members or players within
        sight.
<,>     go upstairs/downstairs. Press '>' to use a void gate (violet '+').
        Void jump gates teleport you to their counterpart and vice versa.
SHIFT+<direction key>
        runs into that direction. Numlock must be turned off probably.
        You can also run by pressing the dot '.' followed by a direction key.
CTRL+P  view previous messages.
CTRL+O  view previous chat messages.
CTRL+X  save your character & quit the game.
Q or CTRL+C or CTRL+K
        lets your character commit suicide (permanently deletes it!).
?       invoke an in-game help screen
CTRL+R  redraw the screen (do this if it's messed up for some reason).

There are also some commands that can be entered with ':' like a chat line.
They all start with a slash '/':

/help       get a help about slash-commands.
/afk        toggle AFK (away from keyboard) mode if you have to take a
            quick break from playing. Note that your character won't
            need to consume food while afk. However, if your character is
            currently on the blacklist of merchants (because you got caught
            stealing from a shop!) your blacklist timer won't decrease either
            while you're AFK!
/que        gives a quest! It needs to be fulfilled before a certain period
 (/quest)   of time passes. The player who completes it gets a great item
            as reward. It will appear right below the player on the ground.
/sip        drink from a fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
            Fountains can have good/bad/no effects.
            (It's easier to press '_' instead of using the /sip command.)
/fill       fill an 'Empty Bottle' in your inventory with the water from a
            fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
(The following function is currently disabled for balancing reasons:
/empty <inventory slot>
            Empty a potion from your inventory, leaving an empty bottle.
            Example: /empty c   (if you have 'c) 3 potions of boldness', one
            will be emptied and 2 remain at 'c) 2 potions of boldness'.))
/ig <player name>
 (/ignore)  ignores all chat messages from the specified player. (Toggle)
/dice       Roll some dice, you must specify a number of dice from 1 to 100.
            The result is random and can be seen by other players who stand
            nearby.
/dis        DESTROYS everything without (non-system) inscription in your
 (/dispose) inventory.
/rec -550   recalls you to -550ft, using an item inscribed {@R}.
/rec 32 32  recalls you to Bree (Town at 32,32 world map coordinates),
 (/recall)  using an item inscribed {RR}.
/dr         Wields all items in your inventory that are: not cursed,
 (/dress)   not {worthless}, not {terrible}, known to you.
/mar        Tells a prayer-user if he may use the prayer 'Holy Martyr'.
 (/martyr)
/note <player> <text>
            Leave a note to another player.
/notes      Display own pending notes.
/notep <text>
            Leave a note to the party you own.
/noteg <text>
            Leave a note to the guild you own.



(0.3) Important inscriptions
----------------------------
All items:
    Inscribing an item with an '!' followed by a key will cause that key to
    cease working on the item anymore.
    Example: You inscribe a 'Scroll of Artifact Creation' this way:  !k!d
    Now you cannot destroy or drop the scroll anymore (keys to destroy and
    to drop an item are 'k' respectively 'd').
    You can uninscribe an item simply by pressing '{', then pressing the ENTER
    key (causes an 'empty' inscription, equal to no inscription at all).
    '*' is a 'wild card' which means it stands for all possible choices.
    Inscribing an item '!*' will prevent any action on it. For example,
    if you wear an artifact and you want to avoid (d)ropping it, (t)aking it
    off or (v) throwing it away accidentally you could either inscribe it
    !d!t!v or just !*  .
    '!*' also implies '!=', so used on arrows it forces auto-pickup. Note that
    !* or !s will NOT save your items from accidentally being (s)old in
    stores.

Items that induce random teleportation, like a 'ring of teleportation' or
'weapon of the thunderlords':
    If the item is _not cursed_ then you may inscribe it with two dots '..' to
    prevent it from teleporting you! In order for the inscription to take
    effect in case you already have it equipped you will need to take it off
    and wield it again.
    The two dots can appear anywhere in the inscription, as long as they are
    not separated from each other. Example:
    A Long Sword Of The Thunderlords (2d5) (+10,+15) {NxFAReg..}

Items that 'can cause Earthquakes':
    !E          will make the item cause earthquakes randomly on striking.

Word-Of-Recall scrolls:
    @R500       will teleport you to depth 500ft (tower).
    @R-350      will teleport you to depth -350ft (dungeon).
    @RW32,32    will teleport you to sector 32,32 on the worldmap (Bree).
                World map ranges from 0,0 to 63,63.
    You must've already been at that depth or deeper in order to teleport
    there via WoR!

Weapons:
    @Ox         Don't auto-retaliate with it. (The letter 'O', not the number)

Ranged weapons:
    @O          Auto-retaliate with it (shooting ammo). ('O' is the letter)

Spellbooks:
    @Oc         You will auto-retaliate by casting the spell 'c)' from this
                book (or any other spell, change the inscription accordingly).

Ammunition:
    !=          will make your character auto-pickup the ammo from the floor.

An item that can be activated:
    @A1         pressing A1 will activate that item.

A potion:
    @q3         pressing q3 will quaff that potion.

A magic scroll:
    @r0         pressing r0 will read that scroll.

etc.. you get the idea. :)

You can also inscribe items just to remember their abilities. For example
if you find an armour that is an artifact, and you found out it resists
fire and acid, you might inscribe it {ResFire,ResAcid} so that you will
remember what it does just by looking at it and reading the inscription.
It can make your life easier if you wear lots of items that have different
resistances or abilities.



(0.4) Typical slang/abbreviations
---------------------------------
Art         Artifact from the a_info.txt file. Also called 'True Art'.
BM          Black Market (Store '7').
Cheeze      Questionable action, not quite cheating but close to it.
            This can be transferring items to a store character (mule)
            or exploiting weaknesses in the game design instead of
            reporting them to the forum.
Dive        A trip into the dungeon, usually quite deep compared to the
            diver's character level.

Excellents  Items that pseudo-identified as 'excellent'.
FA          Free Action (immunity to paralysis).

            In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7
            character levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level
            respectively the same worldmap/wildernis sector.
Phase Door  A short-range teleportation.
Pseudo-ID   If a player keeps an unidentified item for a longer time he might
            'feel' if the item is average, good, cursed or special. The item
            will automatically receive a 'pseudo-id inscription' then.
            Pseudo-id intensity and speed depend on the 'Combat' skill.
Randart     Randomly generated artifact.
Res         Resistance.
Scumming    Repeatedly using staircases up/downwards to make a level become

            last player leaves them to prevent scumming.
Unique      A monster that is named and exists only once (although it can

-Aura of Death and Aura of Shivering aren't implemented at the moment.
-If you press CTRL+X to save&exit the game, you should do that in a safe town.
 Dungeons might change while you are logged off, and the next time you log on
 you might find yourself stuck inside a wall, where the previous dungeon had a
 wide room.
 Another problem is that if you don't leave in a town, your character will
 stay for another 20 seconds in the game before it finally disappears from the
 dungeon! If monsters were around, you might get killed easily during that
 20 seconds.
-The items you find don't depend on your race or class but on monster level
 and depth and luck.
-Spells/round is always 1, even if the number displayed is higher (raised by
 items that effect your 'Spell power' via SPELL flag).
-Don't drop artifacts inside houses if the server doesn't allow artifacts to
 be dropped inside player houses, or you will simply lose the artifact!
-Don't use scrolls of artifact creation on item stacks, it would
 reduce the stack to 1.
 Don't use them on ego items or artifacts, or you will lose the scroll!
 If you use it on items with a discount, the artifact will get it too.
 Watch out: 'Indestructible' and 'Cursed' rings are ego items too, so are
 'Amulets of Telepathic Awareness', 'Rings of Polymorphing' and
 Dragon Scale Mails 'of Defense'!
 In general, it's not always a good idea to try to turn a ring or amulet that
 has high bonus numbers into an artifact, like for example a ring of speed
 (+7) or a ring of slaying (+10,+15) because these numbers will get erased
 and randomly re-rolled; (+to-hit,+to-dam) will always become (+0,+0) even!
-Monster traps (using the Trapping skill) lack a balanced implementation at
 the moment. (Weak)
-The massive iron crown of Morgoth must not be worn by non-Kings/Queens!
-Auto-retaliation with spell books is currently not working.
-Sometimes if you pick up an item from a pile, the next item below doesn't
 become visible on the map. You still 'feel' it if you step on the pile
 though. So if you died and were revived, scan your loot piles on the ground
 carefully to not miss one of your items on the bottom of a pile.
-Scrolls of House Creation don't work at this time and have been removed from
 the game since they had no effect except for generating cash on being sold
 to a shop.
-Undead powers (for players' ghosts) are not available at the moment.



(1) Introduction
================
(1.1) What is TomeNET?
----------------------
It's an extremely advanced online multiplayer rogue-like role-playing game,
derived from MAngband (Multiplayer-Angband). TomeNET bases on the stories of
J.R.R. Tolkien mainly "The Lord Of The Rings", hence the name "the Troubles of
Middle Earth" or alternatively "the Tales of Middle Earth". The final goal in
TomeNET is to destroy the fallen god Melkor who is known by the name of
Morgoth, Lord Of Darkness. The official website is http://www.tomenet.net/ .
Latest version and information also available at http://www.c-blue.de/rogue/ .
The source code is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pernband,
module pm. Access it straight via CVS, avoid any snapshot tarballs and stuff.



(1.2) What is a rogue-like game?
--------------------------------
Rogue was a game basing only on alpha-numerical characters, like letters and
numbers. It didn't have any graphics. Thus it could run on basically every
simple computer. However it was not a text-adventure. Its game engine provides
a grid for turn-by-turn movement and combat that the user looks at from high
above. Here is a small "screenshot":
...............
...########....
...#$.....#....
...#..@...'....
...#......#....
...########.p..
...............
The @ is usually the player, the dots are empty fields. The # are walls. Here
the player seems to be inside a building. In the upper-left corner some money
is deposited. The ' is an open door. Outside of the building there is a p,
which is usually some townsfolk. They are not always friendly and some tend to
steal! Rogue was the first game of this kind, hence all games working with
similar graphics and game engine are called rogue-likes.
Other well-known rogue-likes are Nethack, Larn, Moria, Angband.

    (For help on Internet Relay Chat visit www.irchelp.org )



(1.4) Goal and progress of TomeNET players
------------------------------------------
The final goal that a brave adventurer could possible seek in TomeNET is to
become King respectively Queen. To acquire this he or she must destroy the
fallen god Melkor who is known by the name of Morgoth, Lord Of Darkness.
Morgoth is said to reside deep within the dungeons at around 5000 feet down in
the earth. Getting there will be an extraordinary journey bearing unbelievable
dangers but also fantastic treasure. Players on the same server can also play
together by forming parties and sharing their experience! Players will acquire
new ranks as their experience grows, allowing them to learn new abilities and
to become stronger. Morgoth is said not to show up until his servant Sauron,
the sorceror has been killed.



(1.5) How to encounter the final boss: Morgoth, The Lord Of Darkness
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-Morgoth is found only at dungeon level 100 or deeper.
-He won't show up until you killed Sauron, The Sorceror (at dungeon level 99).
-Morgoth and Sauron do not neccessarily spawn on each fitting dungeon level,
sometimes you have to look a bit for him, like for all other monsters/uniques.
-If a player who hasn't killed Sauron yet or who has already beaten Morgoth
enters a dungeon level where Morgoth is currently on, Morgoth will instantly
teleport to a different dungeon level.
-If there's already another player on that level, who has beaten Sauron but
not yet Morgoth, the 'intruder' player will be teleported to town instead and
Morgoth will remain on the level.
-If a party of players encounters him he will be a bit thougher than
he appears to a solo player, depending on the size of the party.
-There are hardly any walls that can hold Morgoth back for long.

There are rumours of even more powerful beings than the Lord Of Darkness.
Kings and Queens who seek new challenges shall try to enter the Nether Realm,
a dungeon with dangers beyond imagination. Only those who destroyed Morgoth
may enter. The Nether Realm can be very rewarding in terms of experience but
also very deadly. Terrible foes are said to dwell there which aren't seen in
the mundane world.



(2) Installation & setup
========================
(2.1) Installing TomeNET
------------------------
Go to http://www.c-blue.de/rogue.html , download the latest client (version
number sometimes stays the same although a minor update was made, it's at
least 4.0.0 though).
Extract it to a new directory, preserving the pathnames.
You may edit the file "tomenet4.ini" and do some changes to your likings.
If it's not already disabled by default, it is recommended to turn off
graphics ("GRAPHICS=0"). Further you can specify an account name and password
of your own choice. That will relieve you from entering them every time
you join a TomeNET internet server.



(2.2) Starting TomeNET and getting to play on an internet server
----------------------------------------------------------------
To start the TomeNET client, run "tomenet4.exe".
Now TomeNET tries to connect to a meta-server which contains a list of all
available TomeNET internet servers.
After the meta-server has been queried, the list of available servers will
appear in the main window. Choose a server that is near to your location to
avoid high latency. 
This step is reported to often cause problems under Windows XP. If you don't
see that list, or if other problems occur, see (8.4) for possible solutions.
Now you will be prompted to enter your account name and password. You can
choose these freely, the server will save that information and use it to
remember which characters belonged to you the next time you log on.
A player usually has exactly one account that can hold up to 7 characters.
In most cases newly created accounts have to be "validated" by a server
administrator to enable you to use the whole functionality of TomeNET. For
example it is common not to allow unvalidated players to drop items or money
to the ground. This is done to prevent certain cases of abuse.
If you accidentally chose an account name or character name which was already
taken by another player, you will be disconnected with an error message. In
that case, try again with different names.
Now that you have logged in you can create a new player character which will
represent you in the virtual world of Middle Earth!
Player characters are identified by 3 names:
-Nickname (character's name)
-Realname (account name)
-Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
The hostname is not really important. However, make sure that all of these 3
names may only consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and all other characters
with an ASCII code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
The realname and hostname must not be empty. The nickname (character name)
needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z').



(2.3) Behaviour and chat messages
---------------------------------
You can chat with other players by pressing the colon key ':' once you have
joined a game with your character.
In general, don't hesitate to ask questions. Players are usually willing to
help you with the beginnings. Keep in mind that the message window is flooded
with status messages if a player is in combat, that means if you write to
someone while he is fighting monsters he most likely won't notice your
message. Politely try again after some time.
You can scroll back the messages using CTRL+P, or look at chat-only messages
using CTRL+O.

You can also enter slash commands in the chat line. For details about slash
commands see (0.2).

To type a private message to someone, enter <name>:<text>
Example:    Hi!             <- goes to everyone
            C. Blue:Hi!     <- goes privately to the character named 'C. Blue'
In chat messages you can type a double colon '::' to force output of a normal
colon ':' instead of having it interpreted as separator for a private chat
message. Most smileys are recognized automatically and don't require you to
enter a double colon ( ':)' will work equally to '::)' ). (If you want to send
a private message to someone which starts with a smiley, you will have to
enter a space between the private-separator colon and the smiley colon,
example: 'd00d: :)' sends a private message to d00d, containing  ' :)'
while 'd00d::)' will result in a public chat message looking like this
'd00d:)' .)

You can use colours in messages. To change the message colour, put a {
followed by a colour code somewhere into your message line.
Example:
        {pHi!               <- results in a 'poison-coloured' Hi!
        I see some {vh {Bto the east
                            <- results in "I see some h in the east"
                               where the 'h' is violet. The rest of the
                               message is light blue (standard colour).
If you cannot see coloured messages in your secondary Tomenet windows other
than the big main window, check your client option settings by typing  =3
and looking for 'Flicker messages in recall' (recall_flicker). Set it to
'yes'.
If you want to type the character '{' in a chat message, rather than using
it for a colour code, type it twice '{{'. It will become '{'.

Here is a list of colour codes (try not to annoy your fellow players :)
    d   black           b   blue            B   light blue
    D   dark            g   green           G   light green
    s   slate           r   red             R   light red (pink)
    W   white           u   umber           U   light umber
    w   bright white    y   yellow          o   orange          v   violet

    a   acidic          c   cold            e   electric        f   fire
    p   poison          L   light flicker   h   half-multi      m   multi



(3) Creating a character & starting to play
===========================================
(3.1) Creating a new character; character modes
-----------------------------------------------
First you may choose your gender. This will not have actual influence on your
strengths or weaknesses.
Now you have to choose your race. Humans are good allrounders, while the other
races are more or less specialized. For example half-trolls are usually quite
dumb but very strong, and hobbits are quite nimble and intelligent but not
very strong. For more information look at the official website
http://www.tomenet.net/ where you will find descriptions of all races and
classes.
A half-troll warrior might be the best choice for a beginner to try since he
is tough and has less chance of dying instantly in case you make a more
serious mistake. Also you don't have to worry about the spell-casting system
for now. So choose your class, also called profession. Wizards are physically
weaker but cast spells the better the higher their intelligence is, so
choosing a race that is very intelligent might be a good idea, while a race
with high strength and constitution will be fitting a warrior profession.
Now you will see your six basic attributes STRength, INTelligence, WISdom,
DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma. You have to determine how important they
are for you by defining an order. The first attribute you choose will be
raised most. However, know that all your stats are randomly modified slightly,
each character that you create even with same race and class will be a bit
different. Sometimes you are lucky and get really high attributes at the
beginning. And sometimes you get more gold to start with.
Now you can choose a difficulty level you wish to play on. Options are
n) Normal  f) Fruit bat  g) no Ghost  h) Hard  H) Hellish e) Everlasting
It is recommended that you choose either n) to play a normal character or g)
to play a normal character without a ghost.
You can also choose e), that will give your character an infinite amount of
resurrecionts, while 'normal' characters often have a limited amount of lives
(depending on the server configuration).

'Normal':
---------
A normal character will turn into a ghost if he dies. The ghost can be revived
by either visiting a temple or another living player using a magic scroll of
life when standing adjacent to the ghost. The ghost will return to the world
of living under the cost of a lot of experience but at least the player can
resume playing. If the ghost dies, the character will finally be erased
permanently, watch out!
Depending on the server configuration the number of times a ghost can be
resurrected can be limited.

'Everlasting':
--------------
Create an everlasting character for infinite amount of resurrections.
Everlasting characters can become king/queen, but cannot enter the high-score.
Other character types cannot pick up items that belong to everlasting
characters. Non-everlasting and everlasting characters can't be in the same
party.
If an everlasting King/Queen dies, (s)he won't be destroyed but lose the King
status. To regain it, (s)he needs to find another player who hasn't killed
Sauron and Morgoth yet and team up with him, because those two won't respawn.

'Unworldly' (no-ghost) and 'Hellish' (no-ghost + hard):
-------------------------------------------------------
A character without a ghost, as well as hellish characters (who basically are
a combination of 'no-ghost' and 'hard') will be annihilated and deleted
completely on death.

'Hard' and 'Hellish':
---------------------
Hard characters and hellish characters get certain penalties in gameplay.
These are:
-losing -1 to all stats
-healing is reduced by 25%
-AC is reduced by 50%
-ESP only works within radius of 20 squares
-any speed changes above or below +0 is reduced by 50%
-max number of melee attacks is reduced by 1.

'Fruit bat':
------------
A fruit bat is like a normal character, just not in humanoid shape but in bat
form! Fruit bats usually can take way less damage than normal characters
before they die, and they cannot wear certain equipment like boots, gloves or
weapons. However they are twice as fast and hard to hit. Fruit bats are said
to make good explorers.

Hard / Unworldly characters will receive 25% bonus on their high score.
Hellish (Hard + Unworldly) characters receive 50% bonus on their high score.

Note that race and class will have influence on how much experience you will
need to gain a new character level. For example, High-Elves already know a
lot, so experience is hard to gain for them. In fact they will need 100% more
experience than a human.

Creation of your character is now finished and you are asked to press a key to
start the actual game. Do so and take a minute to read the text that will
appear. It is called news or motd (message of the day) and often contains
important server-specific information or announcements to the players.



(3.2) The display (user-interface)
----------------------------------
After you logged in with a character you will now see yourself (you are the
'@' symbol) in the town of Bree in the main window. You can move around in all
8 directions by using the number pad keys! You can run by pressing the SHIFT
key together with a direction key. You can pickup items with 'g'.
The "Choice" window will give an overview of your character attributes and
miscellanous abilities. The "Recall" window will show the contents of your
backpack, also called inventory. All characters except ghosts have a backpack.
The "Mirror" window will show status or chat messages from the server or from
fellow players. If the "Choice"/"Recall"/"Mirror" windows stay empty, see
(8.4) for possible solutions.
To the left border in the main window you see a short overview of your most
important stats, starting with your race, your class and your current title
(the title will change as you gain experience levels by fighting monsters),
followed by your current character level, your amount of experience and your
cash ('Au' stands for Aurum, latin for gold), your 6 character attributes,
your current sanity (sound means you are completely sane, this might drop, for
example if a mindcrafter blasts your mind with psionic energy, leaving you
mad), then comes your Armor Class (AC) which describes you well you are
protected by all the armor you currently wear. The last four values are most
important and will change all the time while fighting monsters.
They are your theoretical maximum of Hit Points (HP) and Spell Points (SP) as
well as the current values of those.
Spell points are very important for wizards, since they determine which spells
and how many of them you can cast. The current hit points (Cur HP) tell you if
you are injured. If they drop below zero you die!
If they are the same as your Max HP then you are fully rested and physically
healed. By the way: If you enter the game and find that you don't like your
character and want to recreate it from scratch, you can suicide by pressing
'Q' (capital Q), followed by confirming the question if you really want to
suicide with 'y' and then finally verify your suicide with '@' key. Often
players are not happy with their character attributes, like Strength,
Intelligence, etc. and try several times until they get a luckier result. Note
that a suicided character is completely and permanently gone (as is a no-
ghost/hellish character on mundane death).



(3.3) Start-up equipment
------------------------
Every new player has some items right from the beginning, stored in the
inventory ("Recall" window). As a warrior you will have a Chain Mail and a
Sword.
Start-up equipment always has level 0 and cannot be used by other players!
You should now equip your start-up items, since they won't help you if
they stay inside the backpack. Press the key 'w', you will be asked which
item you would like to wear or wield, choose the letter in front of the item
inside your inventory, for example e) if the Sword is the fifth item in your
backpack. Equip both, sword and armor this way. You can also equip a
lightsource like a torch or lantern this way. If it is night in town that will
help you to see anything. Inside a dungeon you should always make sure that you
have a lightsource equippped.
The numbers '1' to '9' stand for different shops that you can enter to sell or
buy items. It is recommended that you sell your torches in store '1' (General
Store) and buy a lantern there instead, because a lantern provides more light,
increasing your radius of sight in the darkness. Also buy a flask of oil for
your lantern to refill it if it runs out of oil.
Press '?' to see an in-game introduction and overview of the keys and commands
that you may use. For example 'e' will show your currently equipped items.
You can chat with other players using the ':' key. This way you can also enter
certain commands like /fill to fill an empty bottle with water of a fountain.
At the beginning, all players receive a parchment with their start-up
equipment. It's the "Adventurer's guide to Middle Earth". Press '/' to read
it. It often contains some notes about the server, about player etiquette and
hints for newbies.



(3.4) Preparing the first time for fighting enemies
---------------------------------------------------
Before you enter a dungeon by stepping onto a staircase leading into the earth
(looks like this: '>') and pressing the staircase symbol '>' you will have to
buy some more items for the following reasons:
At the very beginning a single enemy who is a little bit stronger could kill
you easily without you having a fair chance to escape. At the same time,
slaying strong opponents at the very beginning will give very much experience,
thus making your character rise in experience levels and in power very
quickly!
Going deep down into the dungeon with a very low character level in hope of
meeting a monster that gives lots of experience while at the same time is not
too hard to kill is called "diving" and often is kind of suicide while
sometimes very rewarding.
However, buying certain items will greatly raise your chance of escaping from
dangerous situations alive or even slaying tough opponents. Also, by buying
an item (like magic potions or scrolls) your character will remember what it
'looks like' and instantly recognize it if you find some of the same type in
the dungeon. If you find a potion/scroll unknown to your character you will
have to either use it or sell it to a shop or use a scroll of identify to find
out what it is.
So to prepare for hunting in the dungeon, buy:
-Potion of Heroism
-Potion of Cure Light/Serious Wounds
-Scroll of Phase Door
The more you can buy of those the better. At least buy one potion of Heroism
and Cure Light Wounds.
And if you still have spare money (this one costs a lot) a
-Scroll of Word-Of-Recall



(3.5) Creating basic macros & inscribing items
----------------------------------------------
Macros are absolutely obligatory, you _will_ need them, so read this
carefully and if something isn't explained well, ask a fellow player
or send me a mail (mail@c-blue.de) :).
In turn-based single-player rogue-like games you always have enough time to
press "q" (quaff a potion) followed by the according inventory slot, for
example b) (if there is a potion of cure critical wounds in the second
inventory slot).
However, TomeNET is multiplayer and real-time. This means you don't have
enough time to look at your inventory and search the correct letters for items
that you might need *this instance* to avoid certain death. Often, situations
get hectic, for example if all of a sudden a dark elven warlock comes around
the corner while you are engaging a pack of wolves, then you need kind of a
panic button that quickly transports you out of the trouble.
To comply with this need, a macro system has been implemented, allowing you to
program freely choosable keys of your keyboard to perform a series of other
keypresses or commands when pressed. These macros can also interact with
certain items of your inventory by using "item inscriptions". You can inscribe
items (usually with the '{' key) as often as you like to, the inscription is
for example useful if an item has special abilities that you want to remember
by looking at it. You would then inscribe an Elven Cord Armor that you know
helps you to resist the effects of poison. Then it might look like this in
your inventory:
Before: d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10}
After:  d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10} {Res. Poison!}
Inscriptions don't only help you remembering the abilities of certain items,
they can also interact with the macro system and other aspects of the game.
Usually if you want to quaff your potion of Heroism or read a scroll of Phase
Door, you would press qc (q for quaff, then c for third inventory slot for
example) or rd (r for read, then d for the fourth inventory slot, if your
scroll resides here).
However, if you just picked up another potion, your inventory order might be
changed and you had to remember the new positions of your vital potion and
scroll.
Now we are going to create three macros that will instantly quaff the potions
or read a scroll of recall, no matter where in the inventory they exactly are,
on a single keypress! Inscribe the potion of Heroism "@q1", the scroll of
Phase Door "@r1" and the Potion of Cure Light Wounds "@q2".
It should look like this now:
b) a potion of Heroism {+,1} {@q1}
c) a potion of Cure Light Wounds {+,1} {@q2}
d) a scroll of Phase Door {+,1} {@r1}
Now we will create macros that make use of these items. Invoke the macro menu
by pressing '%' key. Then choose "(3) Enter a new action" and enter the two
characters and press Enter:
q1
Now choose "(5) Create a normal macro", then press the F1 key.
Now enter a new action, this time q2 instead of q1. Create another macro, this
time hit F2. Then Enter the third macro, r1, and choose F3 key.
Have your TomeNET client save the macros to a file on your hard disk, in your
TomeNET directory at \lib\user by choosing "(2) Dump macros" and entering a
filename, for example "warrior" or "firstmacros".
Now if you press F1 you will automatically quaff the potion of Heroism, F2 for
Cure Light Wounds and F3 to read the scroll. You are ready to enter the
dungeon now. If you still have some spare money, buy a flask of oil to fuel
your lantern if it runs out, as well as some rations of food in case you get
hungry.
The next time you log on, you may load your previously saved macro file by
invoking the macro menu again ('%'), choosing "(1) Load a user pref file" and
entering the filename.

Note that while it looks like overkill to create macro hotkeys for all lesser
items that aren't of importance during combat, inscribing them can still be
helpful, allowing to easily access them.
Example: You inscribed your flasks of oil @F1 . Now if your lantern is running
low on oil you just type the keys 'F' (to fill) and '1' instead of having to
search your inventory for the correct slot letter the oil flasks reside at.
Same goes for other items that aren't used in time-critical situations during
combat but nevertheless regularly, like scrolls of identify.

Loading macros automatically:
-----------------------------
If you save your macros to a filename that is the same as your character's
name and add a '.prf' at the end, it will be automatically loaded as you
join a game with your character, which is very helpful!
Example: If your character is named 'Kinkan', dump the macros to Kinkan.prf
to have them loaded automatically.
Note: If you're using a Linux version, make sure you don't use capital letters
in the filename. So just 'kinkan.prf'.
Another option is to dump the macros to a file that is named like your account
it will be automatically loaded on all chars of that account.
You can also save macros to <racename>.prf or to <classname>.prf, like
warrior.prf to have them being auto-loaded on all characters of that class.
Priority order (latter one overrides prior one):
pref.prf (global for all OS and users on the system)
user.prf (global, for the specific user)
pref-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)
user-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)
<race>.prf (for the specific race)
<class>.prf (for the specific class)
<account name>.prf (for the account the player logged in with)
<character name>.prf (for the specific character the player logged in with)
It is recommended to use only race/class/account/character preference files.

Command macros:
---------------
Use 'create command macro' instead of 'create normal macro' in case you don't
want the macro to appear on hitting the corresponding key in a normal chat
message (for example useful for '-' key so it won't prevent you from inscribing your
word-of-recall scrolls).
(It is recommended to command macros rather than normal macros.)

Identity macros:
----------------
If you accidentally bound a macro to a key which wasn't free, for example
the key 'r' which is used to read a scroll, you can reset the key by
-pressing % to invoke the macro menu
-choosing '6 - create an identity macro'
-pressing the key wich you want to reset.



(3.6) Creating macros for ranged attacks & abilities (spells)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Those macros basically consist of three parts.
1. Clearing the keyboard buffer (to avoid your character locking up in
   an attack queue if you hammer the trigger button for a ranged attack).
2. Designating a target.
3. Attacking the designated target.
How does the macro look like? (Note: Keys could vary depending on your
key set definitions. Throwing might be 't' instead of 'v' etc.)
For..
a) casting a magical spell
    Press 'm' to see your choices of casting magical spells. Let's assume you
    see this menu then:
        a) create ammo
        b) cast a spell
    Now we want 'b'. Press it to see a list of your magical books in your
    inventory. Let's assume you have learned spell 'a)' from book 'b)' in
    your inventory. Since the order of your books could change if you pick up
    new items or drop old ones, we will inscribe your magical book that is
    currently at position 'b)' like this:
    @m2
    The '2' is our own choice. We could've used 7 or 0 if we wanted to. Note
    that it must be a single digit! @m20 does not work.
    Now we can create the macro.
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -enter:    \e)mb2a*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    m       invoke the ability menu
                    b       choose 'b) cast a spell'
                    2       use the magical book which is inscribed @m2
                    a       use spell 'a)' from this book
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target for the
                            spell!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F1' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -To save your macros, press '2 - dump macros' and enter a filename of
     your choice. If you want your macros to be loaded automatically when you
     log in with your character, save them to '<yourname>.prf'. For example
     to 'Gandalf.prf' if your character is called 'Gandalf'.
     If your macros are not automatically loaded, you'll have to do it
     manually after logging in, by pressing % and choosing '1 - load a user
     pref file', then specifying the according filename.
    Note that if your character gains additional abilities that show up
    in the 'm' menu, it might happen that 'b) cast a spell' becomes
    'c) cast a spell' which requires you to redefine your macros, sorry.
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player)
    Throwing would be done by pressing 'v', followed by the item and either
    one of the 8 directions or '*t' to designate the closest enemy as the
    target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume the item you want to throw is at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) 3 potions of blindness'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the potions @v1 and replace the c in the macro string by a 1.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the potions are currently 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)vc*t      or      \e)v1*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    v       throw an item
                    c   OR  1
                            choose 'c) 3 potions of blindness' OR
                            choose the item for throwing which is currently
                            inscribed @v1
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow)
    The keys we need are 'f' to fire and a direction key or *t to simply
    target the closest enemy.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -Since ammunition for firing or a boomerang is always at a fixed position
     in your equipment, we do not need any inscriptions on the weapon or
     ammunition - the game knows which item we want to use since there's only
     one possible choice.
     enter:    \e)f*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    f       fire an item (boomerang, if equipped) or
                            fire ammunition (if launcher & ammo is equipped)
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand
    Rods are used by 'z' (zap a rod) and wands by 'a' (aim a wand),
    followed by the item and either one of the 8 directions or '*t' to
    designate the closest enemy as target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press '3' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume you want to aim the wand at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) a wand of magic missiles'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the wand @a0 and replace the c in the macro string by a 0.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the wand currently is at 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)ac*t      or      \e)a3*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    a       aim a wand (or 'z' to use a rod here)
                    c   OR  0
                            choose 'c) a wand of magic missiles' OR
                            choose the item which is currently
                            inscribed @a0   (or @z0 for a rod)
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit '5 - create a normal macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing '2 - dump macros' if you
     plan to use it again.

What happens if you leave out the '\e)' part?
Well, that means the commands that aren't processed yet will stay in the
buffer and wait for execution. Example:
You hit the macro  f*t  30 times rapidly. Now your character will shoot 30
times with his bow. However, since he's quite slow, this might take him 30
seconds! You now sit in front of your keyboard and watch your character
process all the remaining 30 shots. If suddenly an enemy appears that needs
you to teleport away since it's too dangerous, you couldn't press any key
until the 30 shots are finished. The character is 'locked'.
The ')' in the macro '\e)f*t' clears all previous keypresses and hence
allows you to hammer the macro without fearing a lock.

A problem with the 'm' key is that it not only brings up your magic spells
but a menu containing all skills you can use. Those can be arrow fletching
or dodging for example.
Now you would have to rewrite your macros each time you gain another ability.
Example:
You are an adventurer who can cast magic spells, so if you press 'm' you
are asked which spell you want to cast.
Now you train in archery, learning the ability to create ammunition from
junk items. If you press 'm' now, a menu will appear, asking you if you
want to create ammunition or cast a magic spell instead. So you of your
macros need to be rewritten to take account of this question.
To avoid this, you can directly choose which skill (ie spell-casting) you
want to use in your macros, by specifying the "ability code"!

Here is a list of all available ability codes:
8   Create ammunition (for archers)
17  Cast monster spell (for mimics)
43  Check your dodge chance
47  Set a monster trap
49  Cast a magic spell / recite a holy prayer

Example for a macro that directly specifies the ability code to cast the magic
spell "a) Manathrust" from book "a) Beginner Cantrips" on the closest monster:

m@49aa*t

What does that mean?
m   ->  invoke an ability
@   ->  specify an ability code directly
49  ->  the code for 'cast a magic spell/recite a holy prayer'
a   ->  cast from book "a)" (Beginner Cantrips)
a   ->  cast spell "a)" (Manathrust)
*t  ->  choose the closest monster as target

(That macro does exactly the same as:
mbaa*t
..assumed that entry 'b)' in the ability menu (invoked by 'm') is
'b) Cast a spell'.)



(3.7)   An example macro set for warriors
-----------------------------------------
Here is an example macro set for a (Thunderlord) Warrior:

Key         Purpose of the Macro                    The macro   Inscription
                                                    itself      on the item(s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F1  fire with ranged weapon at closest target       \e)f*t          -none-
    (you can inscribe your ammunition  !=  to pick it up automatically)
F2  quaff cure critical wound or healing potion     \e)q1           @q1
F3  quaff speed potion                              \e)q2           @q2
F4  quaff restore life levels potion                \e)q3           @q3
F5  read scroll of phase door                       \e)r1           @r1
F6  read scroll of teleportation                    \e)r2           @r2
F7  read scroll of identify                         \e)r3           @r3
F8  use a staff of teleportation                    \e)u1           @u1
    (magic device must be high enough or you keep failing)
F9  quaff a potion of resistance                    \e)q4           @q4
    (an important thing later in the game)
F10 zap some rod (dunno yet which one)              \e)z1           @z1
    (magic device must be high enough or you keep failing)
F11 eat a firestone (Thunderlords only, (5.9))      \e)E1           @E1
F12 use a wand on the closest target                \e)a1*t         @a1
    (magic device must be high enough or you keep failing)

As you can see this warrior is supposed to be able to use quite some magic
for support in addition to fighting. Especially helpful are rods of perception
or of speed. Not all warriors are bright enough to use magic items easily, nor
are players always willing to spend many points on the 'Magic Device' skill.
If you dislike the use of magic your warrior would have to rely completely on
scrolls of teleportation instead. Just make sure you have confusion and
blindness resistance then! (Those two aren't needed to use a staff.)
If you play Thunderlord, kill Dragonriders because they tend to drop a large
amount of firestones. If a difficult combat starts, just eat several of them
to get a larger amount of extra powers.



(3.8) Macros with special keys
------------------------------
You can use so-called 'escapes', meaning a combination of '\' and a regular
key to emulate some special keys in your macros:
\\              the backslash itself. Prevents it from being interpreted as
                the beginning of an escape sequence.
\e              equals the 'ESC' key.
\s              equals the 'SPACE' key. You can also just type in regular
                spaces, which will be converted automatically.
\r or \n        RETURN/ENTER or LINEFEED. Makes no difference.
                Example:
                :hi!\r:hi!\n    makes your character say 'hi!' two times.
)               clears the keyboard buffer (all previous key presses that
                still have to be processed will be forgotten).
Example:
:Hi all!\r      This macro writes 'Hi all!' to everyone.
\e)f*t          This macro will press escape to leave any potential
                running input routine, clear the buffer, fire a shot at
                the closest enemy. You can hammer this macro madly while
                playing without fear of your client processing the key
                presses forever, locking you in a position till your last
                arrow has been shot, since each time you hit the macro,
                it will clear the keyboard buffer (')' symbol) from all
                previous entries.
                The 'running input routine' means:
                If you previously pressed 'q' to quaff a potion, the game
                will now ask you 'Which potion?' and wait for your input.
                If you now see an enemy approaching before you decide which
                potion to quaff, you would usually have to press ESC to leave
                the quaffing input and start firing arrows then. By
                integrating the ESC key into the macro ('\e') this step is
                done automatically.
*I recommend to have all macros start with the '\e)' sequence.*

Miscellanous escape sequences:
\x??            Convert the hex code into an ASCII character. For example
                \x41 (hex 41, dec 65) will become the 65th character of the
                ASCII charset which is a capital 'A'.
\^              The caret '^' or 'accent circonflex'.
\b              stands for the BACKSPACE key.
\t              stands for the TABulator key.
\0?? or \1?? or \2?? or \3??
                stands for an octal code. The code will be converted into an
                ASCII character similar to \x?? hex mode, so \101 becomes 'A'.



(3.9) Level-ups and skill points
--------------------------------
By killing monsters your character gains experience. Harder monsters give more
experience than easy kills. If your character accumulates a certain amount of
experience, (s)he will gain a 'level-up', meaning that (s)he becomes noticably
more powerful than (s)he was until now.
Each character level requires your character to accumulate more experience
than for the level before, up to millions of experience points!
All characters start the game at level 1. At level 50 they are supposed to
fight the bad boss of the game, Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness.
Each time your character gains a new level, (s)he also gains a few skill
points that you can distribute on your character's skills, press 'G' to invoke
the skill chart where you can raise skills of your choice. Do this at a safe
place, so your character won't be attacked and killed while you are looking
at the skill chart. The different skills are described in (6.2). Which
skills your character may specialize in depends on his class (profession),
skills that are not available to your character's class are greyed out and
cannot be raised.
On the skill chart you can press 'Up'/'Down' keys to select a skill and
'Right' key to invest one of your spare skill points into it. Choices cannot
be undone, so be careful here.
At each level-up you gain 5 skill points, so you will have gained at least 250
skill points at level 50. There is a slim chance that you get 6. This chance
can be raised by spending points into the 'Training' skill (see (6.2)).
Further, there is a slim chance that you gain an extra stat point on stats you
are very bad at ("stats" = "attributes" = STRength, INTelligence, WISdom,
DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma). This chance too is increased by the
'Training' skill.
For details about skill point distribution and the different skills see (6.2).



(3.10) Death, ghosts and looting
--------------------------------
Normal/everlasting characters will turn into ghosts if they die. When you
become a ghost, your title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.
You can continue playing as a ghost, getting a slight experience penalty,
but that's not recommended. Instead, you should go for resurrection!

That will bring you back to life at the cost of experience (40% usually).
There are 3 ways to be revived:
-the ghost can visit a temple (green '4' in town). The temple priest will also
 give him some money.
-another living player reads a 'scroll of life' when standing directly next to
 a ghost.
-another living player speaks a prayer of 'resurrection' when standing
 directly next to a ghost. The higher the resurrection spell level was,
 the less experience will be lost.
The ghost will return to the world of living under the cost of a lot of
experience but at least the player can resume playing. If the ghost dies,
the character will finally be erased permanently, watch out!

Depending on the server configuration the number of times a ghost can be
resurrected can be limited (usually to 3 lifes, meaning 2 resurrections).
Unworldly/hellish characters don't have a ghost and are completely destroyed
if they die.
Ghosts slowly lose experience, if they go below 0 they will fade and the
player will be erased completely.

Ghosts have some special abilities, these are
-they can see invisible creatures
-life force can hardly be drained from them
-they cannot be paralyzed
-they spot warm-blooded creatues easily
-they resist darkness effects, blindness, poison, cold, fear and confusion
-they cannot be cut since they don't bleed
-they resist insanity attacks
-they can pass solid walls and mountains
-they can fly
-they cannot use items
-they cannot carry items except for the Book Of The Dead.

Ghosts can access undead powers with 'U' (currently not available, sorry).
Those powers drain your experience. If you use them too often and run out
of experience you will fade away (your character is erased then).

If a character dies totally (no ghost to be resurrected) the level will
(depending on the server configuration) stay static for a while to allow other
players to retrieve his loot. The deeper the dungeon level, the longer it will
stay static. It may take a whole day for very deep levels to 'unstatice'.

If a player dies, an automatic chardump is generated in /lib/user called
'<charname>-death.txt' (see 8.2).



(4) The world
=============
(4.1) Running, picking up items, fighting
-----------------------------------------
If no monsters are within your sight, you are able to run. This
feature was introduced to let you quickly cross empty areas, while it will
cease to work as long as you fight monsters. To run, press SHIFT+<direction>
or type '.' followed by a direction. Running using SHIFT+<direction> will
currently only work if NUMLOCK is turned off unfortunately.
If you want to pick up an item from the floor, step on that field and press
'g' (or press '5' on the numpad, while NUMLOCK must be on).
However, note that the keys can vary depending on your system configuration.
You attack a monster with your equipped melee weapon by simply moving on
the monster's field. Alternatively you can just stay still and let the
monster approach you, if you stand still and an enemy is on an adjacent
field (directly next to you, no space between you and the enemy) then your
character will automatically attack it with the equipped melee weapon.
This feature is called 'the auto-retaliator'. If you want to use ranged
attacks you have several choices.
a) casting a magical spell ('m')
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player) ('v')
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow) ('f')
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand ('z', 'a')
For all types of ranged attacks you'll need to designate a target. As soon as
you finish casting an attack spell or if you press 'f' to fire an arrow/bolt/
pebble/shot the game will ask you for a target or direction. You can now
either press one of the 8 direction keys to fire into that direction, or you
press the asterisk '*' followed by a 't' to designate the closest enemy as
your target, which usually is what you want.
To learn how to create a macro instead of typing all these letters every time
you want to launch a ranged attack, look at
'(3.6) Creating macros for ranged attacks'.



(4.2) Level and owner of items
------------------------------
If you press 'l' to look at an unknown item that lies on the floor, you'll
see something like this:

You see a Long Sword {?} (2d5)

The '{?}' indicates that this item has not yet been 'identified'.
That means we don't know yet if it has certain magic abilities or if it's
even cursed. We just know what we can see with our very eyes, that it is
undoubtful some Long Sword, and all Long Swords do a base damage of 2d5.
If you pick it up it will be displayed in your inventory like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,?} (2d5)

Note the additional '+' symbol. It means that you're now the 'owner' of that
item because you were the first one to pick it up.
Now you want to find out if the sword has any magic abilities. So you read
a Scroll Of Identify (or a Staff Of Perception for example). The sword now
looks like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

Now we know all about it. It's a magical Long Sword (magical because its
magical to-hit and to-dam boni are not 0,0 but 1,5. That means it's an
enchanted Long Sword that magically adds +1 to your hit chance and +5 to
the damage, doing (2d5)+5 damage per hit) that requires its wielder to be
at least level 6 in order to use it.

-Now if you're the owner of the sword then you are able to use it even if your
level is lower than 6 !

-If you give this sword to someone else who is level 4
that person won't be able to use it because he's not the owner.

-If you give the sword to someone who is level 6 or higher, he will become the
new owner! Now you're unable to use the sword if you're level 5 and he gives
it back to you.

-To the owner an item has the '+' sign displayed in its name. Every other
player who looks at the item sees the owner's name instead. Example:
If you drop the sword to the ground and 'l'ook at it, you'll still see this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

but if someone else looks at it, assuming your name is 'Mithrandir', that
person will instead read:

e) a Long Sword {Mithrandir,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

-Last but not least a nasty scenario:
Your character (named 'Mithrandir', level 20) dies and loses his Bluesteel
Blade {+,20}. Now you're a ghost and decide to ask a fellow player (named
'Mugash', level 30) if he can defeat the monsters that killed you and bring
your items to town.
He agrees, you float up to town (remember that ghosts can simply float up
and down anytime by pressing < and >) and revive in the temple (green '4').
If you revive, you'll always lose a bunch of experience. So your level is
now 18 instead of formerly 20.
The level 30 player kills all monsters and picks up your stuff. Since your
valuable Bluesteel Blade requires level 20 the level 30 player becomes its
new owner because he's not lower than 20. He arrives in town and drops the
sword for you.
You pick it up, and whooops it's a Bluesteel Blade {Mugash,20} and you're
level 18. You can't wield it anymore! So the right choice would've been to
ask Mugash if he can buy a Scroll Of Life and revive you in the dungeon
after he killed off all mobs, to avoid him touching your items and becoming
the owner.



(4.3) Dungeons and towers
-------------------------
Look for the staircase ">", step on it and press the '>' key to enter the
dungeon. There is often a so-called newbie tower, which is represented by a
"<", meaning it goes upwards instead of downwards. Enter it by pressing the
'<' key. The newbie tower often allows you to die without suffering
consequences, or is in general easier. An experience penalty might be applied
for killing monsters in the tower (usually 50%). You might ask other players
in game (use ':' to chat) where/if there is a newbie tower (also called
'Training Tower'), or you might search for it yourself.
While inside a town, you get a good overview including the staircases upwards
and downwards by invoking the map by pressing SHIFT+'M' (capital M !).
If you leave a town and explore the wildernis, M will bring up a map showing
you towns and areas that you have explored so far.
After you entered the dungeon, make sure again that you have equipped a light
source! Note the bright dots around you, these are lightened fields within the
radius of your light source. To look at your current dungeon/tower level or
city, press 'L' and use direction keys to navigate on the map.
Also know that there are interesting dungeons found in the wildernis that are
not connected to a town at all!
When you enter the dungeon from within the starting town Bree, you will note
in the main window instead of "Bree" your actual depth is displayed, telling
you on which dungeon level you are. Each dungeon level is 50 feet deeper.
Monsters have approximately the same level than the dungeon level they appear
on. You should try to figure out how deep you can go without dying. The
dungeon depth I can recommend is between 1/3 (if you are _very_ weak) of your
own character level and 3/4 of your character level. You can also go deeper,
in case you want to try diving quickly. On 750 ft you can encounter hounds
(their symbol is a 'Z'). These don't have much Hit Points but give much
experience. They are a famous target for diver.
For a list of the dungeons see '(4.5) Towns'.



(4.4) Terrain
-------------
Town fence-
Grey '#' surround Bree. These cannot be damaged or destroyed.

Town buildings-
Consisting of red '#' (roof) and white '#' (wall), these cannot be damaged or
destroyed.

Walls-
White '#' are permanent walls which cannot be damaged or destroyed.
'#' of different grey tones are granite walls, magma intrusions, quartz veins
and can be tunneled into and take damage from earthquakes.

Water-
On the world map there's lots of water (blue '%' fields). It can be dangerous
to cross it if you're not good at swimming or if you cannot fly :) Further,
nasty creatures are said to live in the seas. Ents cannot drown in water since
they completely consist of wood.
Rivers and lakes are displayed as light blue '~' fields on the world map.
In the main window, all water fields are displayed as blue and light blue '~'.

Mountain chains-
Brown '^' fields are massive and very high mountains. To travel these you need
a climbing set or another item that gives you climbing abilities. Dwarves can
intrinsically travel through mountains. In dungeons '^' rensemble solid
structures of massive rock that reach nearly up to the top of the huge dungeon
levels, climbing these is as hard as climbing mountains above ground.
On the world map mountains are displayed as grey '^', lava mountains are red.

Trees-
Thick trees are rensembled by green or grey '*'. To pass them you need to
either fly over them or to be an Ent, shepherd of trees to whom they will
slightly bow aside to make room. Trees can also be burned up.

Lava-
Red dots '.' are lava, which will do heat damage to your character in
regular intervals. This might also destroy items in your inventory in case
you're not immune to fire.

Floor, dirt, grass-
are displayed as light grey, brown and green dots '.'. On the world map,
they are displayed as either green '.' or yellow ','.

Towns-
are displayed as yellow 'T' on the world map.



(4.5) Towns
-----------
If you create a new character, it will start in 'Bree', a town located at
position 32,32 on the world map (same position on all servers!).
The world map however, ranging from 0,0 (bottom left corner) to 63,63
(top right corner), bears several other towns that you can find and
explore. These towns often contain different shops (some are said to offer
*Identify* service or even a cure to black breath) and harder dungeons.
However, they might also be a very dangerous place to stay, compared to Bree.
In general you can say the harder the local dungeon entrance of a town the
more dangerous monsters can spawn within the town! Bree is the only town that
contains just more or less harmless townsfolk.
The worst are Khazad-dum and Lothlorien, if you go here be _very_ cautious.
Monsters that appear here might look like harmless novice paladins or snagas
but are in fact of a higher level and more powerful.
On servers that run an older version of TomeNET those monsters will be +50
levels higher(!), that means they move extremely fast, take LOTS of damage,
and can kill you easily.
However, it has been observed that people who figured out how to climb high
mountains travelled to Khazad-dum despite their low level for a strange
reason >:-) .
Even if you decide to stay in Gondolin, which is relatively harmless,
don't go afk for a longer time or even a snaga archer might kill you with his
ranged attacks. Always a nasty surprise..

Here is a list of towns and their corresponding local dungeons:

Town        |Depth/Level|   Local dungeons  |   Depth/Level     |Required
            |of the town|                   |   of the local    |player level
            |itself     |                   |   dungeon         |for entering
------------+-----------+-------------------+-------------------+------------
Bree        |   0 ft/  0| Training Tower    | +50..+400/ 1..10  |    1
            |           | Barrow-Downs      |  50..1750/ 1..35  |    1
Minas Anor  |2000 ft/ 40| Paths of the Dead |2000..3500/40..70  |    5
Gondolin    |1000 ft/ 20| Mordor            |1700..3300/34..66  |   15
Lothlorien  |3000 ft/ 60| Angband           |3350..6350/67..127 |   30
Khazad-dum  |4000 ft/ 80| Angband           |3350..6350/67..127 |   30

To enter a dungeon your character must have the displayed minimum level.
Otherwise you'll get a message like this "Suddenly you're grasped by an
uncontrollable fear".

The deeper you decend into the dungeons, the more the passing of time itself
will be slowed down to make it easier to fight very fast monsters. By the time
your character enters those depths, it should already have boosted speed so
the slowdown won't bother you but come in handy. For example if you enter
Mordor you will notice a slowdown to to approx. 1/2 standard time.

Also, there are several dungeons that aren't bound to a town. Here's a list:
Dungeon                         |   Depth/Level         |   Required player
                                |                       |   level to enter

Mount Doom                      | 4250..5000/ 85..100   |       18
Nether Realm                    | 8300..9850/166..197   |       40

The Europe server currently also has an 'ironman' dungeon (see (4.8)):
Wilderness                      |  100..1100/  2..22    |        0

To enter the Nether Realm a player must carry the 'King'/'Queen' title,
acquired by beating Morgoth, The Lord of Darkness.
Each floor in the Nether Realm gives a +20% bonus to experience from monster
kills.
So fighting at 250ft would give 5*20% = +100% bonus, hence doubling the
experience you gain. The amount of experience is already very high even
without the depth-bonus, since creatures in the Nether Realm are of a very
high level.



(4.6) Pits and vaults
---------------------
Usually monsters are found on their corresponding depth. You can browse the
file r_info in lib\game inside your TomeNET directory to find out which
monster occurs where. However there are some exceptions, where you can find
monsters out-of-depth, meaning that you will encounter way more powerful
enemies. That can be very dangerous but also very rewarding. Out-of-depth
monsters usually occur inside of so-called "pits" and "vaults". Pits are very
large and unusual rooms with special structure. Vaults are extremely large
structures of rooms and passages, surrounded by permanent walls that cannot be
damaged. A vault can be a real adventure of its own! If your character isn't
very powerful compared to the dungeon level, you better stay out of vaults
if their structure doesn't allow easy monster killing.



(4.7) Traps
-----------
At the beginning you will encounter traps that can do little damage, some will
decrease your stats temporarily, they are annoying but not a big danger.
However, later on traps will become extremely nasty and you should either get
a very high searching skill or make sure that you have staves, spells or
scrolls that can detect traps. If you encounter a dangerous trap do not try to
disarm it if you are not very sure that you can do it without setting it off.
Fighting traps will become an essential part of the gameplay later on. Vaults
will have *lots* of traps and if you haven't got superior disarming skills (or
wands of disarming / trap destruction) every single move of your character has
to be planned then! This can be especially annoying and dangerous if there are
multiplying or extremely tough monsters inside the vault. If your searching
ability is 'Heroic' or 'Legendary' you will discover most traps instantly just
by coming close to them without having to explicitely search for them.
If you look at an object that is on an already detected trap, you will be
notified about the trap by an ^ symbol in front of the item name and the trap
type appended to it in { } brackets. It looks like this:
^ A potion of Constitution {Chaos Ball Trap}



(4.8) Level & vault feelings, Jail, Ironman
-------------------------------------------
Levels:
Sometimes if you enter a new dungeon level your character will have a special
feeling about it, displayed in orange text.
The feelings are as follows:
"You feel an imminent danger!" ->   This dungeon level is *way* higher than
                                    your character level.
"You feel a suppressive air..." ->  You cannot use magic on this level!
"You have a feeling of peace..." -> You cannot use genocide on this level!
"You lose all sense of direction..." -> This means you won't be able to
                                        auto-map this dungeon, meaning that
                                        you won't remember the dungeon layout
                                        but you're only able to see your
                                        nearby surroundings within your
                                        character's radius of sight.
"You feel like a stranger..." ->    You cannot use magic mapping nor
                                    clairvoyance here!
"The walls here seem very solid." ->    You cannot destroy the dungeon
                                        structure on this level.
Vaults:
Vaults can also bear a very dangerous feature that is displayed as dark grey
feeling as soon as you are about to enter the vault:
"The air in here feels very still." ->  Means that you cannot use any type of
                                        teleportation, including word-of-
                                        recall while inside the vault. Beware!
                                        Further, Wraith Form won't work!
As soon as you leave such a no-teleport-vault you'll receive this feeling:
"Fresh air greets you as you leave the vault."

Jail:
Note that jails (if the server has one) don't allow any type of teleportation
either, nor will you turn into a ghost if you get killed there, instead
you will get destroyed completely. Same as with 'iron man dungeons'.
A jail usually has an ironman tower inside.

Ironman:
Ironman dungeons or towers won't allow you to recall or to use staircases that
lead upwards! If you die in such a dungeon or tower you won't turn into a
ghost either but get destroyed completely. Sending items via telekinesis to a
player who is currently in an ironman dungeon won't work either. To leave an
ironman dungeon/tower you'll have to get to it's bottom respectively top.



(4.9) Navigating on maps
------------------------
The world map is divided into 64 x 64 world map sectors. Each of these sectors
has a size of 4 x 4 smaller sectors (screens). Dungeon levels or tower floors
also have a size of 4 x 4 sectors, same as 1 world map sector. Monsters cannot
cross world map sector borders! Keep this in mind while travelling.

You can scroll around the level within the main window by pressing 'L'. This
allows you to look at all 4 x 4 sectors of your current level. Note that
dungeon/tower levels are often smaller, sometimes even just 1 x 1. While you
are looking around, the current map sector is displayed in the top left corner
of the screen. This information can help other players to find you in case you
need help.

You can press 'M' to invoke a map that gives you a larger overview.
If you press 'M' in a dungeon, tower or a town, you'll see the complete 4 x 4
sectors. If you invoke the map while you're in the wildernis outside of towns,
you will see a part of the 64 x 64 world map, centered around your current
world map sector, displaying towns (yellow T), the sea (blue %), mountains (^)
and other information.

In the main window right below your 'Cur SP' you will see two numbers
separated by a komma, these tell you your current world map sector.
In case you're currently in a town, the town's name will be displayed in the
bottom right corner of the screen.

If you're in a dungeon or tower, you will see your current depth/height in
feet. Each dungeon level or tower floor has a height of 50 feet.
Example: If it shows '-550ft' that means you've descended to the 11th level
of the dungeon. The deeper you go, the more nasty monsters will show up.
Negative depths in dungeons and positive heights in towers mean identical
monster difficulties. Example: In Bree there's a tower and a dungeon. In the
9th tower floor on 450ft you will usually find the same monsters as in the
dungeon on level -450ft (9th dungeon level).



(4.10) Houses
-------------
Press 'h' to buy or sell a house, or to change house parameters (for example
giving all your party members access to it). You need to stand directly next
to the house door to do this.
The house doors can have different colours to you: 
-a green house door indicates that you have access to it,
-a brown house door indicates that the house is currently unowned
 (so you may buy it)
-a grey door indicates that this house is owned by someone and you don't have
 access to it.
If you forgot which houses you own, type ~6 to see a list of your houses.



(5) Item details
================
(5.1) Melee weapons, brands
---------------------------
One of TomeNET's features is the "auto-retaliator". This means, if an enemy
enters a field that is adjacent to you, you will automatically attack the foe
with your equipped melee weapon. This is helpful against lags as well as for
preventing RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury ;).

Melee weapons have at least three stats, it's 'damage dice', 'to-hit' and
'to-damage'. 'To-hit' helps you actually not miss an enemy, 'to-dam' increases
the damage. The 'damage dice' shows how many dice are added to calculate the
random damage you inflict on an enemy as you hit!

Example:  Broad Sword (2d5) (+3,+4)
This means, your chance to hit is a bit increased (+3) and you will inflict
a damage of: 2 dice with 5 sides each, to the result +4 is added.
So the damage you inflict will randomly vary from 6 (1+1+4) up to 14 (5+5+4)
meaning that you do an average damage of 10 per hit with that weapon
([6+14]/2 = 10).

A very important thing about melee weapons is that, depending on your strength
and dexterity as well as the weight of your melee weapon, you might be able to
deliver more than just one blow per round with it!
For example a warrior might be able to swing his "Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+0)"
one time per round, delivering 2*(1..5) damage. The 'd' means dice, so it's
like throwing 2 dice with 5 sides each and adding their values to estimate the
damage you inflicted on the victim. Now if that warrior equips a light whip
which weighs only 3 pounds (the broad sword weighs 15 pounds) he might get 2
or even 3 swings per round! Since a whip does 1d6 damage, he would deal
(assumed he got 2 hits) 2* 1*(1..6) damage, which in total is more damage per
round than he would deliver using the broad sword! Let's compare what happens
if the warrior magically enchants the damage of both weapons, using "Scrolls
of Enchant Weapon To-Dam" (these scrolls can be bought in shop '5').
One of these scrolls can enchant a weapon so one extra point is added to the
damage dice after they have been added. If we manage to enchant the damage of
the broad sword 9 times, the weapon will look like this:
"Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+9)"
That means after 2 dice with 5 sides each have been added, there will be
further 9 points of damage added to the result!

Broad Sword 2d5 (+0,+9) 1 blow per round  -->  1* [ 2*(1..5) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2*((1+5)/2) + 9 average damage which is 15 per round.

Whip 1d6 (+0,+9) 2 blows per round  -->  2* [ 1*(1..6) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2* [ 1*(3,5) +9 ]  -->  2*12,5 = 25 damage per round!
       Far more than with the broad sword.

As you can see, the additional damage caused by enchantment will
be added to the dice result.

If you manage to get your hands on an item that imbues your melee weapon with
an elemental brand (like a Ring Of Ice for example), the dice of your weapon
will be multiplied by 3 if the target doesn't resist that brand.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.

Characters using weapons have a limited number of melee attacks per round,
depending on the character class (profession). A table showing the blow/round
limits is at section (6.5).

While smaller melee weapons require only 1 hand to use them, some larger
weapons need 2 hands. Using a shield together with those is not possible.
Some weapons _can_ be used two-handed. That means you will receive penalties
to to-hit and to-dam bonus if you use it one-handed. Look at your character
screen ('C') to compare the to-hit/to-dam boni and see if it's worth it.



(5.2) Ranged Weapons, brands
----------------------------
Ranged weapons are not to underestimate, they can be very powerful. Especially
characters with low Hit Points will love them since approaching hordes can be
killed at a distance or at least driven back, so they won't come close and hit
the player with devastating blows. It is recommended that you equip a ranged
weapon as soon as possible, and enchant its 'to-damage' to at least +7 !

Ranged weapons have to-hit and to-dam like melee weapons, but instead of
dice they have a 'multiplier'.

Example:  Ranged weapon is:  Long Bow (x3) (+0,+5)
          Ammunition is:     65 Arrows (1d4) (+0,+2)
If you shoot an arrow, it will inflict
( 1d4 +2 +5 ) * 3 damage on the victim. The dice of the arrow varies from 1
up to 4, so we can do a damage of 24 up to 33, so the average damage is 28,5.
We can see here that ranged weapons can do a lot of damage :)

Ranged weapons will be placed in equipment slot 'b)'. After you equipped one,
you need to also equip ammunition that will be used. For example if you use a
long bow, you need to fill your quiver with some arrows. (w)ield the arrows,
and they will be placed into equipment slot 'm)', the ammo slot.
A macro that shoots at the target closest to you, looks like this:  f*t
Explanation in case you really want to know: f means fire, * means entering
targetting mode and choosing nearest target, t means exiting target mode and
remember currently selected target.
To automatically pick up your arrows simply inscribe them:  !=
Ranged weapons can also auto-retaliate, that means you will fire automatically
at targets on sight. To make your ranged weapon behave like that, inscribe the
bow:  @O  (the letter 'O').
However, auto-retaliating with a ranged weapon works only if the enemy stands
on an adjacent field, so it's pretty useless :)

The dice of ammunition are also effected by brands and slays same as normal 
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 2/5.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 2x your melee base damage.
For ranged weapons it will add 2*2/5x of your base damage, so multiply your
base damage by 1.8 instead of by 3 to get your total damage output.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.



(5.3) Martial Arts, brands
--------------------------
The "auto-retaliator" (see 5.1) also works if you fight bare-handed.

Training Martial Arts will give you..
-a bonus to-hit and to-dam
-special combat techniques which your character will use automatically
-special abilities and resistances (like Free Action, see 6.2)
-extra speed bonus
-extra AC bonus for each part of armour that is NOT worn.

A heavy backpack (inventory) will nullify the Free Action. You will see a
message, telling you that your backpack isn't comfortable.

Using a shield will nullify the special combat styles, reducing your damage.

Using too heavy armour or using any melee or ranged weapon will disable your
MA and all benefits completely. The armour weight limit is 10.0 lb + Martial
Arts skill level * 0.5 lb. So for MA 50 it is 10.0 + 25.0 = 35.0 lb.

Martial Arts special combat techniques have certain dice, similar to normal
weapons. These dice are also effected by brands and slays same as normal 
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 1/3.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 2x your base damage.
For MA it will add 2/3x of your base damage, so multiply your base damage
by 1.67 instead of by 3 to get your total damage output.
See (5.4) to get an easy overview.

You cannot use special techniques while stunned or confused.

Here is a list of Martial Arts special techniques:
A technique is picked randomly, then used if random(1..MA_Skill)>chance.
If the chance fails, another technique is picked.
There are MA_Skill / 7 tries to find a technique, otherwise you will hit
without a special technique. There is always at least 1 try to pick a
technique.

Depending on your MA skill, you have a fixed number of barehanded attacks
per round, independent of your character class, your strength or your
dexterity (unlike characters that use weapons):
(The attack number can be increased further by items like rings of extra
attacks or by magical influence like priest prayer 'Zeal'.)
Note that EA effects (like EA ring or Zeal prayer) won't work on characters
who fight barehanded without having Martial Arts skill at 01.000 or higher!

(5.4) Slaying vs brands
-----------------------
If you use a weapon that slays trolls, that means its dice will be tripled if
you hit a troll ('T'). If you have an item that gives fire brand, the dice
would also be tripled by the brand. Slaying and brands are not cumulative.
That means you will get a total dice multiplier of 3 here.
Brands don't stack. The best one is taken. So if you wear a ring of fire and
your weapon does cold damage the dice will be multiplied by 3 if the target
doesn't resist both heat and cold. If the target is susceptible to one of
those the dice are multiplied by 6. Same goes for SLAY flags.

Combat Type | Dice multiplier for brands (fire/cold/acid/lightning/poison)
            | Monster..
            | ..is immune   | ..resists | ..doesn't resist  | ..is suspectible

Giants, Undead, Trolls, Orcs, Dragons, Demons are all 'Evil'.

If several multipliers match the highest one will be used.



(5.5) Weight of weapons
-----------------------
If your melee weapon or ranged weapon is too heavy you will hardly be able
to use it, resulting in reduced attack number per round and less damage.
You will get the message "You have trouble wielding such a heavy weapon/bow"
and probably your blows will drop to 1 and tohit/todam go near to zero.
A weapon is too heavy for you if its weight is greater than the so-called
str_hold value. Below is a table with the str_hold values, depending on a
character's strength:

        str_hold    STRength of             str_hold    STRength of
                    the character                       the character

(5.6) Resistances & caps, Immunities, Susceptibilities
------------------------------------------------------

Resistances & caps
------------------
Several monsters or traps can cause elemental attacks on you. These attacks
can deliver very high damage if you do not 'resist' the specific attack type.
Those 'resistances' become very important in deeper dungeons where many
monsters are able to breathe on you with devastating power.

Permanent resistances (for example if you wear a ring and an armor that both
give fire resistance) will not stack. So one item is suffient for each
resistance. There is no difference if it's a helmet or an armour.
However, a temporary resistance (by potion or spell) and a permanent
resistance can stack. That means if you quaff a 'potion of resist heat'
(temporary resistance) and wear an armour of fire resistance (permanent
resistance) fire attacks will do only 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 of the original damage.

For all attacks the following way of how the final damage is calculated
applies:
If a monster breathes, that attack often has a damage potential of 1/3 of
the monster's hit points.
This 'raw' damage will now be capped at a maximum value that varies for the
different types of attacks.
If you 'resist' that attack, the damage will be cut to further 1/3 (this
value varies for the different types of attacks).

Example:
An Ancient Red Dragon breathes fire.
He has 1500 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 500 damage.
The damage cap for fire attacks is 1200. So the value of 500 remains.
Let's assume that your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down
to 1/3 now, leaving 170 damage.
Example 2:
A Great Hell Wyrm :) breathes fire.
He has 5000 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 1700 damage.
Since 1700 is greater than the cap (1200) it becomes 1200.
Let's assume your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down to 1/3,
leaving approx. 400 damage.


Overview:
Breath damage is capped, the number is given in the corresponding description.
Bolts and balls are not capped (except for the general damage cap of 1600).
Their damage maximum is depends on the level of the casting monster as the
formulas show. The total maximum damage an attack can do in TomeNET is 1600
(general damage cap for all breath/bolt/ball attacks).

There are four so-called 'basic resistances'. These are
Fire/Heat               These attacks can burn items in your inventory.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Fire immunity allows you to travel over lava without
                        you or your inventory getting harmed.
                        Fire bolts do (level/3)+(9d8) damage.
                        Fire balls do (level*7/2)+10 damage.
Frost/Cold              These attacks can shatter potions.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Frost bolts do (level/3)+(6d8) damage.
                        Cold balls do (level*3/2)+10 damage.
Lightning/Electricity   These attacks can destroy rings and amulets.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your dexterity.
                        Lightning bolts do (level/3)+(4d8) damage.
                        Lightning balls do (level*3/2)+8 damage.
Acid.                   These attacks can destroy items in your inventory.
                        They can also damage your equipment if you don't
                        resist acid.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your charisma.
                        Acid bolts do (level/3)+(7d8) damage.
                        Acid balls do (level*3)+15 damage.
Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Damage of these attacks is capped
at 1200 (always before resistances are applied).
If you resist them, the damage will be cut to 1/3. If you are suspectible to
them, like Ents to fire, you will take twice the damage! This also applies for
aura attacks like hitting someone who wears a cloak of immolation.
To prevent side-effects of the attacks on your inventory from occurring you
will need the according immunity! Resistance is only sufficient to protect
your equipment, not your inventory.
Magic rods are always immune to all kinds of attacks.

Then there's 'poison resistance'. This one doesn't belong to the basic
resistances but is also very essential at the beginning.
If you resist poison you will not only take just 1/3 of the poison damage but
also be protected from poisoning effects.
Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Poison breath caps at 800.
Make sure that you have the basics and poison resistance before going far
deeper than 1000 ft.
Poison balls (also known as Stinking Clouds) do 12d2 damage.

There are also three minor resistances:
Fear            While you're afraid you won't be able to attack a target in
                close combat.
Blindness       You cannot read scrolls or books while you're blind.
                Blindness can be caused directly by a blindness attack or by
                indirectly by light or darkness attacks if you don't resist
                those. You still can use magic staves, rods or wands and
                quaff potions. Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or
                Cure Critical Wounds will remove the blindness.
Confusion       While confused you cannot move, shoot or fight straight.
                Further, you're unable to read scrolls or books.
                However, you still can use staves, wands and rods.
                Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or Cure Critical Wounds
                will remove the confusion.
                Resisting confusion or chaos will lower damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Confusion damage caps at 400.
Paralysis       Paralysis can be caused by bashing doors, lack of food and by
                traps or enemies. Against the latter two effects you can
                become immune by equipping a 'Free Action' item. You should
                become immune to paralysis before descending below 1000 ft.
Hold Life       This will provide some protection against experience drain.

Further, there are several high resistances. Those are
Water           Water resistance is rare. Water attacks can stun and confuse
                you if you don't resist them and usually do a lot of damage.
                Resistance will cut damage to 1/3.
                If you're a mimicking an aquatic monster the damage will be
                further cut down to 1/4.
                If you don't wear a 'tarpaulin' items in your inventory might
                be destroyed by the water (if they don't resist water).
                Water bolts do (10d10)+level damage.
                Water balls do 50+(1...[level*5/2]) damage.
Sound           Sound attacks do less damage but can stun your or even knock
                you out so you will die as if you were paralyzed. Free Action
                won't help you then.
                Resistance will cut damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Damage is be reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Thunderlord -also known as
                Dragonrider- eats a firestone and gets the 'adrenaline'
                message. See (5.9) for firestone details.)
                Sound resistance will protect you from stunning effects.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Sound breath caps at 400.
Shards          Shard attacks can cause nasty cuts that makes you bleed
                heavily if you don't resist them.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage is be reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Thunderlord -also known as
                Dragonrider- eats a firestone and gets the 'adrenaline'
                message. See (5.9) for firestone details.)
                Shard resistance will protect you from cuts.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Shard breath caps at 400.
Nexus           Nexus attacks can have extremely nasty side-effects if you
                don't resist them. Those are
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Teleport you towards the monster.
                -Teleport you a dungeon level higher or lower.
                -Swap two of your six stats randomly!
                -Destroy items in your inventory.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3. Nexus breath caps at 250.
Chaos           Chaos attacks can also have nasty side-effects if you don't
                resist. These are:
                -Confuse you.
                -Let you hallucinate.
                -Drain some experience. Resisting 'Nether' will also prevent
                 this.
                Resisting chaos will also make you resist confusion attacks.
                Resistance will cut down damage to 6/9..6/15.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Chaos breath caps at 600.
                Raw chaos invocation (chaos ball) does (level*2)+(10d10) dam.
Light           Light effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                If you are mimicking a monster that is suspectible to light
                you will suffer double damage from attacks.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Light breath caps at 400.
Darkness        Darkness effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Darkness breath caps at 400.
                Darkness Storms (balls) do (level*5)+(10d10) damage.
Nether          Having 'Hold Life' can protect from experience loss.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent life
                draining (experience loss).
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Nether breath caps at 550.
                Nether bolts do 30+(5d5)+(level*3/2) damage.
                Nether balls do 50+level+(10d10) damage.
Disenchantment  This attack does massive damage and can also disenchant your
                equipped items, lowering their to-hit/to-dam/to-ac bonus!
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent
                disenchantment of your equipment.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6, it caps at 500.

Irresistable/extremely powerful effects:
Force           Pure force impact (BR_WALL). Raw damage is monster HP/6.
                Force impact (breath only) is capped at 200 and irresistable.
Inertia         Inertia attacks will slow you down a lot. There is no 'Inertia
                resistance' but 'Free Action' will slightly reduce the
                slowdown duration.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/6 and caps at 200.
Gravity         These attacks have very annoying side-effects:
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Slow you down.
                -Stun you if you don't resist sound.
                It's impossible to resist gravitation. However, having
                'Feather Falling' (also known as Levitation) will reduce the
                damage your body takes from the shockwave and cut the damage
                to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/3 and caps at 150.
Mana            Mana is pure magical energy. There are only rumours
                about items that provides resistance against it.
                Resisting it will cut damage to 1/2.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3, breath caps at 250. Only very
                few monsters (mostly uniques) can breathe mana.
                Mana bolts do 50+(1...[level*7/2]) damage.
                Mana storms (balls) do (level*4)+(10d10) damage. Beware!
Time            Time is pure temporary distortion. There are only rumours
                about items that provides resistance against it.
                Time attacks can have very nasty side effects:
                -Drain experience (Hold Life won't help).
                -One of your stats can be lowered (resistance will reduce the
                 amount).
                -Drain all your stats (resistance will prevent this).

                (Rockets are treated internally like breathing.)

Immunities
----------
Players can become immune to the basic elements, poison and water by wearing
items (for excample dragon scale mails of the corresponding colour) or by
transforming into a monster shape that carries the according immunities
(see (6.7) about mimicry details).
If a player is immune to an element, (s)he won't take any damage from those
attacks or any side-effects. Example: Wearing a Black Dragon Scale Mail
which provides Water Immunity makes the player take 0 damage from a water
bolt attack and also protect him from the stun+confuse effect of water bolts.
(It won't protect him from the stun/confuse effect of other attacks though.)

Susceptibilities
----------------
Some monsters are susceptible against certain elements. For example fire
hounds are susceptible against cold attacks.

Physical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in a doubled multiplier for
branded attacks. Example: If the player hits a Cold Hound with a
fiery broad sword (2d6) the Cold Hound will receive 2d6 * 6 damage
instead of 2d6 * 3 (usual brand multiplier for melee weapons).
Also see (5.4) for a table of brand multipliers.

Magical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in double damage for the
according elemental attacks (ie cold ball vs fire hounds).

Magical/monster attacks vs players:
Players can be susceptible against an element too. For example Ents are
susceptible to fire by nature. Immunity will completely cancel out the
susceptibility. If an Ent wears an item of fire immunity it will suffer
0 damage from fire attacks, same as any other character.
If a susceptible player without immunity is hit by the according elemental
damage type, the damage will be doubled!
If a player is susceptible to an element and at the same time wears an item
that provides resistance then both factor in: Damage = Damge * 2 / 3.
(If the player also has temporary resistance then the damage will be
multiplied by 1/3 once more, as usual.)

Physical attacks in pvp are not influenced by susceptibilities.



(5.7) Qualitative classification of items
-----------------------------------------
Items are classified by
-a basic item type
-a simple magical enchantment (to hit-chance, to damage, to armour class)
-an excellent magical enchantment (some examples: resistances on armours,
 elemental brands on weapons, enhanced brightness on light sources)
-an ego power (for example a weapon 'of Gondolin' or a cloak 'of aman')
-sometimes you may find an artifact which can have quite a bunch of
 different powers combined!

If you find an item, it's 'unidentified'. That means you see only the
basic item type.
Example:
A whip (1d6) {+,?}
The ? indicates that you don't know yet which level is required to wield
this item. You have to identify the item to find out more about it.

Assuming you identify it you could get one of the results below:

Example 1:
A whip (1d6) (+0,+3) {+,1}
This is a magical whip. Magical, because its damage is enchanted to +3.
It doesn't possess any further special abilities.

Example 2:
A Fiery Whip of Gondolin (1d6) (+8,+11) (+3)
This is an ego-weapon ('of Gondolin') with a fire brand ('fiery'). The
base weapon type is a whip which makes it belong to the hafted weapons.
Its to-hit and to-damage are magically enchanted to +8 and +11.
Gondolin weapons increase strength and constitution (here +3).

Ego-items or excellent magical items often have varying abilities.
For example a Gondolin-weapon _can_ have HOLD_LIFE, a high resistance,
or increase your dex. It doesn't _have to_, however. To find out the
complete powers of an item it can be neccessary to *identify* it.
*Identify* (same as *Perception*) reveals the complete ability list.
You can check the complete list of items in stores by pressing 'x' to
'examine an item'. You can review the ability list of an item in your
inventory or equipment using the 'I' key. Using 'I' requires that
you already *identified* the item or bought it from a shop.
Some shops offer an *identify* service but they are quite expensive.

Sometimes an item turns out to be an artifact!
Artifacts are unique. If an artifact is owned by a player, noone else
can find it anymore until it's lost (for example if the player dies)
or sold to a shop. Depending on a server's configuration artifacts
usually stay a while in the shop and can be bought by other players
before they finally disappear from the stock.

There are static artifacts and random artifacts ('randarts').
Static artifacts are predefined and have fixed abilities. Their number
therefore is limited.
In case all static artifacts are found, players can still find randomly
generated artifacts so a server won't run out of artifacts.
Artifacts of any type cannot be enchanted by any means.

If a player holds an unidentified item long enough he/she might get
a 'feeling' about it. The more points in 'Combat' skill the player has
the faster and clearer he can feel the items value. This is called
'pseudo-identifying'. Warriors are more likely to pseudo-id than casters.
If a player pseudo-ids an item, the 'feeling' will be appended in { }
brackets to the item name.
Items display the following pseudo-id tags:

-Basic items, non-magical:      {average}
-Magically enchanted items      (good}
-Excellent magical items        {excellent}
-Artifacts (random & static)    {special}
-Cursed items                   {cursed}
-Useless items (often cursed)   {worthless}
-Cursed artifacts / egos        {terrible}
 Note that some cursed artifacts can be very powerful.

Note that potions and scrolls don't have 'egos' or 'artifacts', but some of
the pots/scrolls show similar pseudo-id tags.



(5.8) Special abilities of items
--------------------------------
FEATHER ('It allows you to levitate.')
        'Feather Falling', also called 'Levitation'.
        Lets you resist gravitation effects. Lets you float down gently
        if you accidentally stumble into pits.
FLY     ('It allows you to fly.')
        Allows you to cross water areas without drowning. Enables you to fly
        over trees (running won't work, try walking field by field).
MANA ('It affects your mana capacity')
        Will increase your total spell points (mana) by +x0%. Example:
        Gloves of the magi (+3) increase your mana by 30%.
        MANA items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
        They have slightly less effect on non-mages and quite less effect
        on priests or paladins who need wisdom rather than intelligence.
LIFE ('It affects your hit points')
        Will increase your total hit points by +x0%. Example:
        Sword of life (+2) increases your HP by 20%.
        LIFE items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
AGGRAVATE ('It aggravates nearby creatures')
        Wakes up all monsters in whose radius of awareness you are, hastes
        monsters in your line of sight.
LUCK ('The item increases your luck')
        If you are lucky, your chance to find better items increases.
        Luck caps at 40, having higher bonus won't help any more.
        The higher your luck is, the more diminishing is the effect.
NO_MAGIC ('Antimagic shell')
        Raises your saving throw to 95%, making you nearly immune to any
        malicious magical influence (like paralysation). Also prevents
        you from using any magic device or casting spells.
ANTIMAGIC ('Antimagic field')
        Prevents you from using any magic device or casting spells, also
        applies to nearby enemy spellcasters and other players. The
        field has less influence on _party members_ who try to cast.
        The radius is approximately the field power / 15. The field
        power is the chance of suppressing a spell. It caps at 95%.
BLESSED ('It has been blessed by the gods')
        These weapons resist cursing. Priests can use blessed weapons
        without penalties, even if they are not 'hafted' (blunt).
VAMPIRIC ('The weapon drains life from your victim')
        Drains life from your victim, which you gain as hit points.
VORPAL ('Sharp' weapons)
        Has a chance that weapon dice result is multiplied on hitting,
        you'll see 'Your weapon cuts deep into your enemy'.
CHAOTIC ('Your weapon produces chaotic effects')
        On hitting, you have a 50% chance to do one of the following:
        a) drain life (VAMPIRIC) (very likely)
        b) earthquake
        c) confuse target (very likely)
        d) teleport target away
        e) polymorph target
IMPACT ('It can cause earthquakes')
        Causes earthquakes if the damage is > 50.
WOUNDING ('It is very sharp and makes your foes bleed.')
        Has additional to-hit/to-dam bonus.
CAPACITY (of Capacity) ('It can hold more mana.')
        No effect currently.
CHEAPNESS (of Cheapness) ('It can cast spells for a lesser mana cost.')
        No effect currently. Traps of cheapness have halved timeout duration.
EASY_USE (of Simplicity)
        You have a much higher chance of succeeding to use the magic device.
CHARGING (of Charging) ('It regenerates its mana faster.')
        This magic device (rod) will take only 1/3 of the usual time to
        fully recharge.
FAST_CAST (of Quickness) ('It can cast spells faster')
        Magic device can be used twice as often over a period of time.
Istari (of the Istari)
        Combination of CAPACITY, CHARGING, CHEAPNESS and FAST_CAST.
FUEL_LITE ('It provides light radius when fueled')
        A light source that needs to be fueled, otherwise it runs out.
(NO_SEED 
        An ego item that is never created randomly (in terms of abilities
        or power).)
CURSED  If you wield _any_ cursed item, you'll need to break the curse in
        order to take it off again. Shops won't buy cursed items.
        You need a Scroll Of Remove Curse or the according spell to uncurse
        a CURSED item, or you can try enchanting one of its base boni
        (tohit/todam/toac) above 0, assumed it HAS those.
AUTO_CURSE
        This item will re-curse itself if you equip it or pick it up or
        take it off even. So make sure to drop an equipped auto-cursed item
        to the ground after uncursing it, instead of just taking it off.
HEAVY_CURSE
        You need a Scroll Of *Remove Curse* or the according spell to break
        this curse, or you can try enchanting one of its base boni
        (tohit/todam/toac) above 0, assumed it HAS those.
CURSE_NO_DROP
        You cannot even drop this item while it's cursed.
TY_CURSE
        No effect, except for lowering the items value.
DG_CURSE
        No effect, except for greatly lowering the items value.



(5.9) What does item xxx do exactly?
------------------------------------
Some items might look bad (Mushrooms of Unhealth), but keep in mind that you
can often throw ('v') these items to damage or impair an enemy.
For more information about items and especially ego items see (7.4).

Weapons & Armour
--
Dark Sword      Dark Swords have a so-called 'antimagic field', which
                prevents the user from using magic items or casting spells,
                but also has a chance to interrupt enemy spellcasters.
                The chance to interrupt spellcasters is 50% minus the to-hit
                and to-dam values of the dark sword. Dark Sword (+3,+4) has
                50-3-4 = 43% chance of interrupting spellcasters.
                The radius of the antimagic field is several fields, getting
                smaller if the chance is smaller than 50%.
Magic Arrows    Those will return into your quiver magically, so you need only
                one of them really. Same goes for artifact ammunition of any
                type. (Magic Arrows can be destroyed by fire or acid though.)

                Drains your HP for each one removed.
                The race will be determined by the monster which stands
                closest to you when firing off the spell. For each monster you
                will suffer 4+(monsterlevel/8) points of damage, which cannot
                be absorbed by any magic shield or other protective effects!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining
                hit points might be halved (extra penalty) after the spell
                finished (this penalty is enabled by default).
                Monsters have a chance to resist genocide, depending on their

                by any magic shield or other protective effects!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining
                hit points might be halved (extra penalty) after the spell

Mushrooms with bad effects are also often poisonous.



(5.10) Destruction of items by elemental attacks
------------------------------------------------
Items in your inventory can be destroyed if you are hit by an elemental
attack. Those attacks even have a very slim chance of destroying an item
that you have equipped!

In order for an item to guaranteedly survive such an attack, you must either
be immune or double-resisting (have permanent AND temporary resistance) to
that specific element.
Some items have IGNORE_xxx flags which let them ignore certain elements,
preventing them from being destroyed.
All artifacts, random and static ones, cannot be harmed by elemental attacks
of any type.

Here is a table of items and which elements they are susceptible against:
"Impact" happens if you fall into a pit, smashing some potions on hitting the
floor. Items that IGNORE_COLD also resist impact damage.
Usually items that contain wood, leather or stuff are susceptible to fire and
acid, while things that consist only of metal are just susceptible to acid.

(5.11) Armour Class vs monster attacks
--------------------------------------
Armour class helps you twice:
-It makes monsters miss you more often.
 The more AC the better, it's weighed against the level of the attacking
 monster. If the monster is (heavily) stunned it gets penalties here.
-It reduces the damage if a monster manages to hit you.
 This effect caps at 150 AC!

Monsters can score critical hits which can (depending on the attack type)
result in a cutting or stunning effect against the player.
A monster scores a critical hit if it inflicts a damage which is very close to
its theoretical maximum. Weaker monsters (that don't inflict high amounts of
damage) aren't able to score critical hits at all.
The power of the resulting cut/stun depends on the damage too.
So a high armour class helps a lot, to avoid critical monster hits and to
reduce their power.



(6) Tables
==========
(6.1) Attributes
----------------
Depending on your race and class you will have different character attributes.
These stats are always modified randomly a bit, so two characters of the same
race and class still don't have completely identical values here.
Here are questions that are related to your character attributes.
The attributes are also called 'stats'.

Stats are displayed as values from 3 (minimum) to 18. It is possible to gain
even higher stats, those will be displayed as 18/xxx where xxx is roughly the
value above 18 multiplied by 10 (to allow fractions). Examples:
18/10 is like 19.
18/120 is like 30.
18/47 is like 22. The fraction 0.7 is not factoring into actual gameplay.

If you quaffed the maximum of "stat potions" (potions raising your stats), the
maxed out attribute will be displayed in light umber.
An attribute is maxed out at 18/100 +/- racial/class modifiers.
Examples:
Human Adventurer has 18/100 + 0 + 0 = 18/100 cap for all stats, see (6.4) for
race boni and (6.5) for class boni.
Thunderlord Istari has an intelligence cap of 18/100 + 2 (Thunderlord) + 3
(Istari) = 18/150.

Stats can be raised over the character's cap by equipment. The total possible
maximum of an attribute is always 18/220 (40), which is displayed as 18/***.

Strength (STR)      
    -How heavy may your weapon and bow be? You can't fight with a weapon that
     is too heavy for you.
    -How heavy may your armour be? You will lose mana or Martial Arts abilties
     if it's too heavy for you.
    -How much damage do you inflict on enemies?
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
Intelligence (INT)  
    -How much mana for spellcasting do you have?
    -How well can you cast spells?
    -How well can you handle and use magic devices?
Wisdom (WIS)        
    -How well can you cast priest prayers? (certain spells that are for priests)
    -How well can you resist malicious influences like poison, paralyzation,
     or insanity?
Dexterity (DEX) 
    -Has positive influence on your armour class and on your chance to hit
     enemies.
    -How well can you steal (from shops)? (A high DEX won't help much if your
     'Stealing' skill is zero by the way ;)
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
Constitution (CON)  
    -How many HP (hit points) do you have? Very essential.
Charisma (CHR)      
    -Do you get good prices in shops? :)



(6.2) Skills
------------
If you rise in character levels by gaining experience, you also get skill
points to distribute on various abilities. To invoke the skill system overview
press 'G' (capital G!). Skill points that have been distributed can not be
taken back.

Here is a list of the available skills and brief explanations to each one:
Note that not every skill is available to every profession (class).

+Combat                         Ability to pseudo-ID items: You can sense if
                                items are terrible, worthless, cursed,
                                average, good, excellent or special. At the
                                beginning you will only feel 'cursed' or
                                'good'. Raise combat skill over 10 to get
                                more distinctive feelings. Lets you wear
                                heavier armour without spell point penalties.
                                A powerful warrior (combat>30) senses the use
                                of ranged weapons and ammunition much better,
                                even if (s)he's not comfortable with archery.
                                A very powerful one (combat>40) can also sense
                                the use of magical items much better.
                                Increases Fear/Stun/Confuse duration of the
                                target (if attacking causes those).
                                Slightly increases to-hit bonus for all weapon
                                types and to-damage bonus for melee weapons.
    +Weaponmastery              Improves your Fighting ability.
                                Slightly increases melee to-dam and to-hit.
                                Increases your chance to score critical hits.
        +Sword-mastery          Greatly improves to-dam/to-hit with swords.
                                At 25 and 50 you will get +1 blow per round.
            .Critical-strike    Ability to score 2x/3x/4x damage hits.
                                Critical strike skill works with light
                                weapons. Weight cap is 10.0 lb, above this
                                the chance to hit your target critically won't
                                be worse than with a 10.0 lb weapon.
                                Although your chance of hitting critical spots
                                is better with lighter weapons, the damage of
                                your critical strike -IF you manage to execute
                                one- is higher if your weapon is heavier.

        .Hafted-mastery         See Sword-mastery
        .Polearm-mastery        See Sword-mastery
    +Archery                    Improves ranged to-damage bonus.
                                Increases your chance to score critical hits.
                                Also lets you create ammunition from bones,
                                skeletons and rubble on the floor (press 'm').
                                (You can't pick up rubble; if you want to make
                                ammunition from it, just stand next to it!)
                                50 in archery grants +1 'extra might',
                                increasing your launcher's multiplier by 1.
                                Lets you pseudo-id ranged weapons and
                                ammunition easier if raised over 10.
        .Sling-mastery          Imcreases hit chance with slings.
                                At 16,32,48 you will get +1 additional shot
                                per round each.
        .Bow-mastery            See Sling-mastery
        .Crossbow-mastery       See Sling-mastery
        .Boomerang-mastery      See Sling-mastery
    .Martial Arts               Ability to fight with bare hands.
                                Slightly raises you character speed.
                                Lets you attack with special combat styles.
                                At 10 you receive Feather Falling (Levitation).
                                At 15 your character gets fear resistance.
                                At 20 your character gets confusion resistance.
                                Gives you 'Free Action' (immunity to paralysis)
                                at skill level 25.
                                At 30 you're able to swim without problems.
                                At 40 your movement is perfected enough to
                                cross even highest mountains.
                                At 50 a martial artist will learn the
                                technique of flying!
                                A heavy backpack (inventory) will nullify the
                                Free Action. You will see a message, telling
                                you that your backpack isn't comfortable.
                                Using a shield will nullify the special combat
                                styles, reducing your damage.
                                Using too heavy armour will disable your MA.
                                Using any melee or ranged weapon disables your
                                Martial Arts skills completely.
                                The dice of martial arts special techniques
                                (which your character will use automatically
                                depending on your MA skill) are affected by
                                elemental brands, but slightly less (2/3 as
                                much) as normal weapons.
                                Martial Arts gives you a chance / adds to your
                                chance of intercepting an enemy! See
                                'Interception' skill below.
+Magic                          Improves your spellcasting abilities and
                                increases your mana capacity.
                                Lets you pseudo-id magic items, potions and
                                scrolls easier if raised over 10.
    .Magic-device               Ability to use magic devices (wands,rods,etc.)
                                without failing. Also increases their power.
    .Spell-power                Increases the power of learned spells by
                                adding a bonus to the spell level.
                                At 50, it will raise spell levels by 40%.
                                (It won't raise the level of spells which you
                                haven't learned yet.)
    .Sorcery                    Ability to use all magic schools!
                                Comes at the cost of your hit points!

                                You also inherit the monsters abilities,
                                weaknesses and resistances!
                                To find out details about a monster form
                                look into the file r_info.txt in your
                                tomenet/lib/game directory!
+Sneakiness                     Slightly increases your character speed
                                (+7 at 50, so approx +1 every 7..8 points).
    .Stealth                    Increases your stealth, which determines
                                if monsters can hear you from a distance
                                or if you can sneak past them. Note that even
                                Thunderlords -also known as Dragonrider-
                                can become stealthy by using this! (Without
                                further +stealth items, stealth of a TL
                                Adventurer will become 'poor' instead of 'bad'
                                with Stealth at 26.000.)
    .Disarming                  Increases your disarming ability
    .Trapping                   Increases your ability to set traps
    .Backstabbing               Lets you backstab enemies, afflicting high
                                damage. Works best in the dark and if the
                                opponent is sleeping.
    .Stealing                   Ability to steal (from shops)! Very nasty >:)
                                If you get caught, you will be on the
                                'blacklist of merchants' for 15 minutes up to
                                2 hours, depending on the item you tried to
                                steal from a shop. During this time it's
                                basically impossible to steal, and you will
                                get BAD prices (blackmarket-style) in shops.
                                Your chance to steal an item from a shop
                                depends on your dexterity, your stealing skill
                                and the price and weight of the item.
                                For example it's nearly impossible to steal a
                                large piece of wood without the store owner
                                noticing it, although it's not worth much :)
                                There's always a minimum chance of 5% to fail!
                                You need to be at least level 10 to steal.
                                The chance to successfully steal an item is
                                usually never smaller than 5%, even if your
                                stealing skill is 0 and your dexterity low.
                                If a shop offers an item more expensive than
                                it actually is (black market) that has no
                                effect on stealing. The 'normal' item value
                                is used to calculate the chances.
                                It's more difficult to steal from special
                                stores (expensive black market and especially
                                rare footwear/jewellry/secret black market).
                                The calculation for successful stealing is
                                very complicated. Some random examples:
                                Speed pot, dex 18/70, skill 20 -> 70% chance.
                                Heal pot, dex 18/50, skill 25 -> 65% chance.
                                Massive Piece of Wood, dex 18/140, skill 40
                                -> 15% (it's *heavy*, 250.0 lb).
                                It's a good idea to wear as many +DEX items
                                as possible while trying to steal from a shop.
    +Dodging                    Ability to evade attacks. Doesn't work well
                                if you wear heavier armour.
        .Calmness               Ability to not get hindered by enemies.
                                For example adjacent foes can interfere if
                                you try to shoot with a bow.
        .Interception           Ability to interfere with adjacent enemies.
                                Can prevent them from teleporting, casting,
                                summoning, running away. The chance to
                                intercept an enemy is (2 * interception) +
                                (martial_arts_skill / 2) - (enemy_level / 3).
                                Example: Chance to intercept summoning of the
                                Balrog of Moria with maxed interception is
                                (2*50) + 0 - (50/3) = 84% base. Now since it's
                                spellcasting it's reduced to 75%: 84%*75%=63%.
                                For Morgoth it's (2*50)+0-(100/3) = 67% base.
                                To intercept his spells it's 75% of 67% = 50%!
                                (A maxed out martial artist would have 69%.)
                                Interception chance is recuded to 33% while
                                you are blind.
                                Interception chances also depend on what the
                                enemy is trying to do. Certain actions are
                                harder to intercept, those reduce the chance
                                further, to..
                                100%    for shooting
                                 85%    for running (fleeing / stepping back)
                                 75%    for casting a spell / summoning
                                 50%    for teleporting / phasing (blinking)
                                Note: While ball/bolt attacks are spells,
                                      breathing is NOT.
                                Interception chance caps at 90% (cap is
                                applied after all other penalties have been
                                factored in, at the very end of calculation).
+Necromancy                     Drains life from killed monsters
                                (the skill level in HPs from each kill).
    .Aura power                 Increases the power of your auras.
    .Aura of Fear               Monsters that hit you are stroke by fear.
    .Shivering Aura             Monsters that hit you are stunned.
    .Aura of Death              Monsters that hit you are hit by waves
                                of plasma and ice.
    .Antimagic                  Generated from your strong disbelief in magic
                                an anti-magic field surrounds you, preventing
                                attempts from other casters to cast spells or
                                summon monsters. This effect is cumulative
                                with the anti-magic field of a Dark Sword.
                                It's capped at 90% chance of interrupting
                                enemy spells.
                                Note that as soon as you invest a point into
                                this skill you won't be able to use any magic
                                wands,staves or rods anymore!
                                Further, this skill also slightly affects
                                your fellow party members (casters).
                                Each point in Antimagic adds 1% to your total
                                AM chance, so the max gain is +50% from skill.
                                Note: While ball/bolt attacks are spells,
                                      breathing is NOT.
+Health                         Increases your hit point regeneration rate.
                                If you spend 10 points into Health, your
                                sanity will be displayed as a bar.
                                At 20 points you'll get the percentage
                                displayed. At 40 the value will be shown.
    .Training                   Increases the chance of getting an additional
                                skillpoint or even a stat-point on level ups.
                                Note that all characters already have a slim
                                chance to get an additional skill/stat-point
                                on level ups. The weaker an attribute is, the
                                more likely it's raised.
                                (If random(0..99) < training you will receive
                                an extra skill point on level up.)
    .Swimming                   Self-explaining
    .Digging                    Self-explaining
    .Climbing                   You need this at 01.000 to learn climbing.
    .Flying                     You need this at 01.000 to learn how to fly.
    .Free Action                You need this at 01.000 to resist paralysis.
    .Confusion Resistance       You need this at 01.000 to resist confusion.

In my opinion, 'Health' and its sub-skills should be avoided. There are more
important skills to care about.

Here is what the numbers mean (we will use the Axe-Mastery skill for this
example:

+Combat                         10.500  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               5.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-Mastery            15.000  [0.500]

As we can see this player has 10.5 skill points in Combat, 5.25 in
Weaponmastery and 15 in Axe-Mastery. He just reached a new level and hence
gained 5 skill points. Now he decides to invest them all into Axe-Mastery.
He presses <DOWN> key until the Axe-Mastery line is selected. Now he presses
<RIGHT> key 5 times to invest all his 5 spare skill points here.
Axe-Mastery will be increased by 0.500 points per invested skill point (hence
the [0.500] on the right), leaving him at 17.5 Axe-Mastery now.
Since sub-skills always slightly affect their parent skills, Weaponmastery
and Combat will also be raised slightly. The result might look like this:

+Combat                         10.750  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               6.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-Mastery            17.500  [0.500]



(6.3) Abilities
---------------
Depending on your race and class, you will be better or worse at certain
abilities. You can see your abilities in the character screen (press 'C').

Fighting
    How well you can fight, how easily you get disarmed.
Bows/Throw
    How well you can shoot/throw.
Saving Throw
    How well you can resist attacks that have influence on your status
    other than just hit points. For example poisoning, confusion or
    paralyzation.
Stealth
    Determines if monsters will immediately wake up if you're nearby or if
    you are able to sneak past sleeping monsters without waking them.
Perception
    Determines how easily you spot hidden traps or doors on adjacent fields
    without even searching for them.
Searching
    Determines how easily you spot hidden traps/doors on adjacent fields
    while explicitely searching for them (with 's' or 'S').
Disarming
    How well you can disarm traps (without setting them off), and how likely
    you avoid them if you accidentally step on a field that contains one.
Magic Device
    How well you can use magic items like wands, staves, rods (these are often
    especially hard to use) or activate magic items like Dragon Scale Mails.
Blows/Round
    How often per round you are able to strike with your weapon. This depends
    on your strength, dexterity, your class, your weapon. (Note that Yeeks
    are limited to 4 blows per round.)
    Spending points in specific weapon masteries will give you an additional
    blow at 25 and at 50 (like sword or hafted mastery).
    Tables of blows/round limits are at (5.3) (for martial arts) and at (6.5)
    (for melee weapons).
Shots/Round
    How often per round you are able to use your ranged weapon.
    Spending points into specific archery skills will give you additional
    shots at 16, 32 and 48 skill points.
    Mimics get additional shots per round if the monster form they use has
    the ability to shoot with ranged weapons.
Spells/Round
    How many spells per round you can cast. Usually 1.
Infra-Vision
    How far you can see warm-blooded monsters in the dark.
    10 ft equal a distance of 1 field.
    Having this above zero can be very helpful for fighting monsters while you
    are blinded, since IV still works then.

Note that your age, height, weight, social class and gender don't have
influence on the gameplay at this time.



(6.4) Races
-----------
Depending on your race, you might need different amounts of experience to gain
a new character level. You also might have certain intrinsic abilities.
To see numerical tables about races and classes, visit http://www.tomenet.net/
and click 'Doc' in the menu on the left.
(Descriptions here are partially taken from www.tomenet.net )
For Beginners a powerful but simple race/class combination like Half-Troll
Warrior is strongly recommended.

Human
    Humans are allrounders with no special weaknesses or strengths.
    Humans have no experience penalties and tend to go up levels faster than
    most other races. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters
    choosing human.
Half-Elf
    Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as strong.
    Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws,
    stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
    Half-elves do not receive any intrinsic abilities. 
Elf
    Elves resist light effects intrinsically. Elves are better magicians then
    humans, but not as good at fighting. They tend to be smarter and faster
    than either humans or half-elves and also have better wisdom. Elves are
    better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and magic,
    but they are not as good at hand weapons.
Hobbit
    Hobbits have their dexterity sustained. Further, they get a dexterity bonus
    from not wearing shoes! Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows,
    throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching
    disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but
    prefer to be called burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good
    at melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect
    warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Hobbits resist black breath somewhat.
Gnome
    Gnomes are intrinsically protected to paralysis effects. Gnomes are smaller
    than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the hobbits, live in the
    earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent Warlocks & Sorcerers, and
    have very good saving throws. They are good at magic, searching, disarming,
    perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are
    not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision,
    so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance.
Dwarf
    Dwarves can never be blinded and at level 30 they learn to travel across
    even the highest mountain regions.
    Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
    are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
    or priest. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less
    intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat
    wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very
    good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one big
    drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud
    voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out
    challenges at nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable
    stealth.
Half-Orc
    Because of their preference to living underground to on the surface,
    Half-orcs resist darkness intrinsically. They make excellent warriors and
    decent priests, but are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at
    stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs
    are quite ugly, and tend to pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make
    good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to
    have great constitutions and lots of hit points.
Half-Troll
    Half-trolls have their strength sustained. They are very strong, but also
    very stupid and slow. They make great warriors and iffy priests. They are
    bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly
    that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. Half-trolls have their
    strength sustained and also happen to be fun to play. They need to eat
    often.
Dunadan
    Dunadain have their constitution sustained. Dunadain are a race of hardy
    men from the West. This elder race surpasses human abilities in every
    field, especially constitution. However, being men of the world, very
    little is new to them, and levels are very hard for them to gain.
High-Elf
    High-elves resist light intrinsically and can see the invisible. They are
    a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time, masters of
    all skills, strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes
    suspect. They do very well in all   professions. There are few things that
    they have not seen already, and experience is hard for them to gain.
Yeek
    Being weak and losing many childhood fights, they have learned the
    ability to float gently to the ground. They have intrinsic feather
    falling (same as 'levitation' effect).
    Yeeks are the least powerful of all the races. They suffer disadvantages
    in all stats and have attributes similar to humans. However, to
    compensate Yeeks learn, and thus gain levels, extremely quickly.
Goblin
    Goblins resist darkness intrinsically. Goblins have a decidedly
    mixed reputation. They are almost always grinning, and more often than
    not you cannot tell whether or not they are eyeing you like a side of
    meat. They are as sturdy as Dwarves and are quite agile making them
    good fighters, rogues, and mimics. Being creatures of the night,
    Golbins have natural resistance to darkness.
Ent
    The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world,
    eldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the
    land, they were summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth.
    Being much like trees they are very slow but strong and do not have
    to eat as often. Because they consist of wood, they are quite
    susceptible to fire and they don't drown in water. As the Shepherds
    of the Trees, they can learn to sense the presence of others, such
    as animals  at level 10, orcs at 15, trolls at 20, giants at 25,
    dragons at 30, demons at 40 and all evil-minded creatures at level 50.
    Ents can pass trees. At level 4 they learn to see invisible things.
    Trees will slightly bend aside to let ents pass through. They accumulate
    experience very slowly. Ents do not eat normal food, but are able to
    consume liquids. Ents resist the force of unleashed water.
Thunderlord (also known as Dragonrider)
    Thunderlords can eat firestones to temporarily boost their powers.
    They have an intrinsic telepathic vision of all nearby creatures, the
    radius expands as they gain levels. At level 5 they can spot dragons
    anywhere on the level. They even gain intrinsic basic resistances,
    fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20 and electricity at 25. At level 30
    they learn how to fly. Thunderlords are not very wise, and need a very
    long time to gain experience. They need to eat often. Thunderlords have
    feather falling from birth. See (5.9) for firestone details.

(6.5) Classes/Professions, titles, melee blows/round
----------------------------------------------------
Depending on your class, your start-up equipment and your skill tree will
vary. For example a warrior cannot learn magic spells.
To see numerical tables about races and classes, visit http://www.tomenet.net/
and click 'Doc' in the menu on the left.
(Descriptions here are partially taken from www.tomenet.net )

Adventurer
    Adventurers can train nearly all skills, but are not very good in a
    specific one. Their magical power is basing on their intelligence as well
    as wisdom.
Warrior
    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
    by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
    a magical device. Their prime stats are Strength and Constitution, and a
    good Dexterity can really help at times. A Warrior will be good at melee
    and bows, but bad at most other skills. A Warrior learns no magic but can
    train to use magic devices. A warrior has more attacks per round than any
    other class.
    Warriors can decide to become 'Unbelievers' by spending points into
    the 'Anti-magic' skill. As soon as they spend the first point here
    they will immediately become unable to use any magic wand/staff/rod!
    The full opposite of Sorcerers, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
    not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in
    the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally incompetent when
    trying to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read
    scrolls. Because they are so unattuned to magic, Unbelievers can prevent
    magical gates from opening around them, eventually extending to a complete
    suppression of teleportation abilities and all magic in the area around
    them.
    Warriors can also become monk-like fighters, by training the Martial Arts.
    The warrior class is recommended for beginners.
Istari (elvish word for Mage)
    Istari use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have
    to cast spells and how low their failure rate is.
    They are the all-around best magicians, having the most powerful spells.
    A high-level Istari can be very powerful , but getting there can be a
    difficult journey. On the downside, they are the worst fighters, being
    unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and still unable
    to be anything even remotely approaching effective with it.
    An Istari and especially Sorcerer (that's an Istari who specializes in
    'Sorcery' skill) also has the fewest hit points of any class, making
    survival difficult in the beginning.
    This class is not recommended for beginners.
Priest
    Priests use certain divine magic. Unless mages they have a fair
    fighting potential with hafted or blessed weapons. Priests can learn
    many spells that are helpful to their party members. Priests use mainly
    wisdom for their prayers, determining the amount of mana and how low their
    failure rate is.
    A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
    to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
    fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their church!
    They are very good with magical devices, preferring to call them
    instruments of their god, but are not as good as a Istaris in their use.
    Priests also have excellent saving throws due to divine intervention.
    Priests make decent fighters, preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.
    Wisdom is the priest's primary stats.
    Note that priests get a penalty for wielding non-hafted weapons, except
    for BLESSED weapons which priests can use without problems independently
    of their type.
Rogue
    Rogues can backstab (works especially well in the dark) sleeping or
    fleeing monsters, and they can train stealing from shops, creatures
    or players. Due to their high dexterity they can often hit several
    times per round with light weapons.
    A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by cunning, but is capable of
    fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and locks, no
    device is impossible for him to overcome. A rogue will learn to set many
    kinds of traps as they become more experienced. Rogues have very high
    stealth allowing them to sneak around many creatures without having to
    fight, or to sneak up and get the first blow, backstabbing his opponent.
    A rogue's perception is higher than any other class, and usually they
    notice traps or secret doors without needing a search. Rarely will a
    rogue be unable to avoid or disarm a trap. Rogues also have the unique
    ability to train stealing from his fellow man, a dangerous but sometimes
    very rewarding profession. Rogues are better than warriors or paladins
    with magical devices, but still can not rely on their performance.
    Rogues can also learn a few spells. A rogue's primary stats are
    Intelligence and Dexterity. 
Mimic
    Mimics can learn how to shapechange and use monsters' forms, thus
    inheriting nearly all of the monster's abilities. Mimics learn forms
    by killing as many of a certain monster type as that type has a high
    level. Further, their 'Mimicry' skill must be at least 1/2 of the
    monster level. If mimics kill monsters whose level is higher than
    2 x their mimicry skill those kills will nevertheless be counted in
    case the skill is raised to the appropriate level later.
    Example: To use the form of an Ancient Bronze Dragon (level 40) the
    mimic has to kill 40 of them and have a mimicry skill of at least 20.
    To find out how many monsters you already killed and how many you need
    in total to learn a form, press the '~' key followed by '3'.
    To polymorph into a form, press 'm' key, like casting a magic spell.
    To find out the special abilities of a monster form, see section (6.8).
Archer
    Archers aren't good at fighting, but can deliever extremely high damage
    with their ranged weapons. They can die quickly too, however.
    Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
    around with any bow/xbow/sling but are especially powerful with bows.
    An Archer is very bad at melee, being only better than the Sorcerer.
    Archers can create ammunition from the bones of their opponents.
Paladin
    Paladins are a combination of warrior and priest. Holy knights that
    fight the evil with hammers and swords as well as divine support.
    Paladins are nearly as strong as pure warriors. They cannot become
    unbelievers.
    Paladins are not very good at missile weapons. They are poor at 
    stealth, perception, and searching. They are better than fighters
    with magical devices and have a decent saving throw due to divine
    protection. Their primary stats are strength and wisdom, although
    intelligence can slightly help too.
Ranger
    Rangers are a combination of warrior and mage. They are also skilled
    trappers and devoted to nature. They cannot become Unbelievers.
    They are good fighters, and quite effective with bows, second only to
    Archers. Rangers have good stealth, perception, searching, saving
    throws, and are good with magical devices. Rangers are a
    jack-of-all-trades class who can find several different ways out of
    any situation. They use intelligence for spellcasting, same as mages.
    At level 20 rangers learn to find paths passing thick woods.

If you raise in levels, you will get new titles. These are displayed between
your class name and your character level in the main window. If you die and
become a ghost, the title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.


Here is a table showing boni/mali of the different races:
'Blows/Round' is the maximum number of melee attacks per round a character can
have basing on strength and dexterity and on the weapon's weight.
To that maximum of blows per round further boni are added, like extra blows
from a specific weapon-type mastery or from rings of extra attacks or magical
influence from priest prayer 'Zeal'.
Note that these blow/round limits don't count for Martial Arts users (as long
as they fight barehanded). See (5.3) for a table of MA attacks.

(6.6) Sanity
------------
Your sanity can have the following values:
Sound, Sane, Weird, Insane, Mad, Vegetable.
If you spend 10 points on your 'Health' skill, the sanity display will turn
into a bar, displaying exacter values.

At the beginning, your sanity is always 'Sound'. That means you are completely
sane. Monsters or traps can reduce your sanity. If your sanity drops to zero,
your mind will be qualified as an unthinking vegetable, this means your
character is permanently dead, so be extremely cautious! Fortunately there are
potions available that cure your sanity, although they are not very common and
cannot be bought in shops. Wisdom helps against insanity by inceasing your
'sanity capacity'. As you gain levels, your sanity capacity will also increase.
However, this means IF your sanity drops to dangerous regions, you will need
more potions to cure it.

If your sanity is lowered, there's an increasing chance that flashbacks will
storm your head, leaving you with mad visions for a while..



(6.7) Mimic details, polymorph rings
------------------------------------
To find out the special abilities of a monster form, consult the file
/lib/game/r_info.txt in your tomenet directory, and look up the monster.
It's abilities will transform to the mimic's body as follows:

W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
  depth:
    The depth is also the basic level of these monsters. It tells you how
    many of them you need to kill to learn mimicking their form.
I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
  speed:
    110 means normal speed. If the monster is faster, the mimic will
    receive a speed bonus of 60% of the monster's speed above 110.
    If the monster is slower, the mimic will receive a speed malus of
    40% of the monster's speed malus below 110.
    So a monster moving at 130 speed will give the mimic +12 speed.
  hit points:
    The monster's hit dice xdy are multiplied. Now, if the mimic's HP
    are less then the result, the mimic's HP will become approx.
    ((x*y) + mimic_HP) / 2. This value is capped against ~2700, so gain
    might decrease in higher regions. (1/2 monster HP, 1/2 player HP.)
    If the mimic's HP in player form (0) are greater than x*y, the
    resulting HP will be ((x*y * 2) + (mimic_HP * 5)) / 7.
    (2/7 monster HP, 5/7 player HP.)
  armour class:
    Mimicking a monster is already a very difficult task. By changing
    shape, the usual armour class of the monster will magically influence
    the armour class of the player.
    Depending on the body parts of the monster, its AC has different
    influence on the player. The following formula helps:
    body_influence = 0.
    if the monster has a head, body_influence is increased by 1.
    if the monster has a torso, body_influence is increased by 3.
    if the monster has arms, body_influence is increased by 2.
    if the monster has legs, body_influence is increased by 1.
    calc_ac = monster_AC * 14 / (7 + body_influence)
    Now if calc_ac is smaller than the player's AC, the final AC will be
    (3/4 player_base_AC) + (3/4 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/4 calc_ac).
    Otherwise, the final AC will be
    (1/2 player_base_AC) + (1/2 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/2 calc_ac).
  Alertness:
    Searching ability of the player =
    (player_searching / 2) + (monster_alertness / 10)
    Perception of the player = 
    (player_perception / 2) + (monster_alertness / 10)
E: weapons : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
    These values indicate how many pieces of equipment the player can
    wear while using this form. For example snakes can only wear a helmet
    (E:0:0:0:0:1:0).
B: attack method : attack effect : damage
  attack effect:
    If the monster poisons or infects with disease, this will result in
    a poison brand. Similar it's for fire/cold/lightning/acid attacks.
    BLIND won't work on monsters that have NO_SLEEP, otherwise the target
    will be confused.
    HALLUCINATION and CONFUSE won't work on monsters that have NO_CONF,
    otherwise the target will be confused.
    TERRIFY won't work on monsters that have NO_FEAR, otherwise it'll
    scare the target.
    PARALYZE won't work on monsters that have NO_STUN, otherwise it'll
    stun the target.
    EXPxx means the monster drains life on attacking. The player will
    receive HOLD_LIFE (resist life-draining attacks) from this form.

    Monster effects (like poisoning or paralyzing) are also applied to
    the player's attacks, with a probability that corresponds their
    rarity over the up to 4 monster attacks per round.
    (If the monster has 3 blows per round and one of them is poisoning,
    the other two are paralying, the mimic will have 1/3 chance to do
    a poison branded attack and 2/3 chance to do a stunning attack.)
    These effects won't be applied if one of the following conditions
    is met:
    a) The player is doing a ranged attack.
       (Effects only works with melee attacks!)
    b) The player uses a weapon but the monster doesn't have an
       inventory slot for melee weapons).

    Melee to-damage bonus also depends on the monster form:
    The monster damage dice for each attack are multiplied and the products
    are all added up, the result is divided by 4. If the monster can't use
    melee weapons (no equipment slot for melee weapons), the result will
    be doubled (after it was divided by 4).
    The result is now capped against 200, the closer this graph comes towards
    200 the flatter the curve will become.
    This value is now compared against the player's melee to-damage bonus.
    If (monDam > toDam) then newToDam = 1/2 toDam + 1/2 monDam.
    If (monDam < toDam) then newToDam = 3/4 toDam + 1/4 monDam.
    So the monster damage has only a small influence if it's lower than
    the player's to-damage bonus, but it has a high influence if the
    monster is more powerful than the player.

    The chance for an attack effect to go off is (number of blows with
    this effect) / (total number of monster blows). That means a Ghoul
    has 2/3 chance to execute a poison branded melee attack, and 1/3
    chance to perform a stunning melee attack.
    monster's blows 
F: flag list
    The flags are translated to mimic abilities as follows:
    RES_xxx     Gives the mimic the specific resistance.
    IM_xxx      Gives the mimic the specific immunity! If a form offers
                more than 2 immunities, 2 will be picked randomly, the
                remaining ones will turn into resistances. Potions of
                self-knowledge are helpful here.
    PASS_WALL   Will allow the mimic to pass walls like a ghost.
    KILL_WALL   The mimic will dig easily through walls.
    REGENERATE  Faster hit point regeneration.
    CAN_SWIM    The player can pass water fields without problems.
    CAN_FLY     The player can fly.
    STUPID      -2 intelligence.
    SMART       +2 intelligence.
    NO_CONF     Confusion resistance.
    NO_FEAR     Fear resistance.
    NO_SLEEP    Free action.
    NO_STUN     Sound resistance.
    NO_CUT      The player can't be cut and won't bleed continously from
                wounds.
    DISBELIEVE  Will increase the player's anti-magic field by
                ((monsterlevel / 2) + 20) percent. The range of the anti-magic
                field is increased by ((monsterlevel / 15) + 3) fields.
    ARROW       The player will receive an additional shot per round.
    1_IN_3 or 1_IN_2
                If the monster has the ARROW flag, the player can shoot an
                additional shot per round, because the monster seems to be
                good at it.
                If the monster doesn't has the ARROW flag, the player can
                cast an additional spell per round instead.
    1_IN_1      If the monster has the ARROW flag, the player can shoot an
                additional shot per round, because the monster seems to be
                superb at it. Otherwise, the player can cast an additional
                spell per round.
    WILD_WOOD or ANIMAL
                The player (like the monster) can pass trees.
    INVISIBLE   The player becomes invisible.
    AURA_FIRE or AURA_ELEC
                The player receives an aura.
    SUSCEPT_FIRE/SUSCEPT_COLD/SUSCEPT_ELEC/SUSCEPT_ACID/SUSCEPT_POIS
                The player is susceptible against these attacks. Dangerous!
    WIERD_MIND  Insanity attacks are reduced by 25%. (Overrides S-flags)
    EMPTY_MIND  Insanity attacks are reduced by 50%. (Overrides S-flags)
    AQUATIC     Gives superb water resistance.
    NEVER_MOVE  Using this form, the player won't be able to move (except for
                teleportation/phasing/recalling).
    RAND_25     The player has +10% chance of moving randomly.
    RAND_50     The player has +20% chance of moving randomly.
    OPEN_DOOR   This form can open doors.
    BASH_DOOR   This form can bash doors
                (useful to forms that cannot OPEN_DOORs!).
    EVIL        This form will take 2x damage from holy orbs or holy fire.
    HURT_LITE   This form will take 2x damage from light attacks.
S: spell list
    These spells can be cast by the monster. Most of them are available to
    the mimic too, some of them have slightly different effects.
    BR_xxx      (breathing) will give the according resistance to the player
                (if that specific attack CAN be resisted at all).
    BR_PLASMA   gives plasma & fire resistance.
    BR_GRAVITY  gives feather falling.
    BR_INERTIA  gives free action.
    MIND_BLAST  Insanity attacks are reduced by 25%.
    BRAIN_SMASH Insanity attacks are reduced by 50%.

Further, certain races and classes get abilities:
Bats        Feather falling (levitation)
Elves       Resist light
Dark elves  Resist darkness
Hobbits     Dexterity bonus of +2 for not wearing shoes.
Gnomes      Free action
(Dwarves    Blindness resistance, climbing at level 30.)
High-elves  Resist light, see invisible
Yeeks       Feather falling (levitation)
(Ents       Slow digestion, speed - 2, sensible to fire, see invisible at
            level 4, can swim, pass trees)
All ghosts  See invisible, Infra-vision +3
All orcs    Resist darkness
All trolls and giants
            Sustain strength
All dragonriders
            ESP_DRAGON at level 5, feather falling, flying at level 30.
All undead creatures
            Resist darkness, blindness, poison (usually immunity);
            can't bleed (no_cut), infra-vision +1, insanity attacks are
            reduced by 25%.
All non-living creatures
            Resist poison (usually even immune) and fear; insanity attacks
            are reduced by 50%.

Keep in mind that by changing forms you can potentially lose abilities that
you had in player form, because they were bound to your normal form.
Example: An ent mimic won't drown in water, but if it polymorphs into an orc,
it loses the intrinsic ability to pass water since orcs aren't made of wood.


Polymorph rings:
----------------
There are two types of polymorph rings, those which already provide a monster
form and those which can still be forged by a mimic. Latter ones are named
'Rings of polymorphing of player', while the first ones are named after the
monster form.

A player can use a ring that carries a monster form, by wearing it and
activating it. The user needs a mimicry skill of at least 1/2 the level of
the monster in order to activate the ring. After the form-change, the
ring can be taken off and the form will stay.
Rings of polymorphing have a certain chance to break after activation,
depending on the user's mimicry skill (if the ring is indestructible or not
does not matter here!). The ring breaks just after the player has been
polymorphed. The chance of breaking (in percent) is roughly:

mimicry skill       monster level       break chance
----------------------------------------------------
 1..50              0                   11%..11%
 5..50              10                  20%..16%
15..50              30                  31%..18%
30..50              60                  28%..20%
50                  100                 12%

Players can also create monster rings out of 'polymorph player' rings, by
mimicking the according form, then wearing the ring and activating it.
The ring will turn into a ring of polymorphing of the current monster form.
However, to create such a ring it is required that the player has already
learnt that form. A large part of his knowledge will be absorbed into the
ring, so if he just learnt the form he will now have forgotten it and depend
on the ring to use it, or kill more monsters to re-learn it.

If the player has killed less than 4 times as many monsters as he needed to
learn the form (4 x monsterlevel) his kill counter will be lowered by the
monsterlevel on forging the ring.
If the player has killed at least 4 times as many monsters as needed to learn
the form, his kill counter will be halved on forging the ring.

The level of the ring will change depending on the form. Here are some levels:
form level              ring level
----------------------------------
      1                     15
     30                     28
     60                     38
    100 (theoretical)       44



(6.8) Magic spells and prayers
------------------------------
Istari (mages), rangers, rogues, priests, paladins and even adventurers
can cast magic spells or speak prayers. To do so, they need the according
spell books or tomes (larger books that contain several normal books) in
their inventory.
Those books can be purchased in store '9' (the 'book store') or in '7'
(the 'black market' - very expensive but you often find tomes here!).

(6.9) Parties, Iron Teams, Guilds
----------------------------------
Press 'P' to display the party menu.
Here you can..

-Form a party
    In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7 character
    levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level respectively
    the same worldmap/wildernis sector. A slight experience bonus is applied
    for killing monsters in a party.
    Set a house owner to 'party' to allow all party members to access that
    house.
    If the owner dies, the whole party is disbanded and all houses of the
    party are wiped. 
-Create an iron team
    An iron team is like a party with the following differences:
    An 'Iron Team' can only be formed with newly created characters. Its
    members will only get experience for killing monsters if ALL members
    are online and on the same dungeon level!
-Add a player to your party
    This can be done by all members of the party, not just by the owner!
-Remove a player from your party
    This can only be done by the party owner.
    Note that if you remove a player from an iron team and his character has
    already gained some experience he will be unable to join again.
    If the owner removes himself from his own party, the whole party is
    disbanded and all houses of the party are wiped.
-Leave your current party.
    Note that if you leave an iron team and your character has already gained
    experience you will be unable to join again.
    If the owner leaves his own party, the whole party is disbanded and all
    houses of the party are wiped.

-Specify player to attack
    Now you are hostile to that player and you will hurt each other like
    when fighting a monster (this includes auto-retaliating and targetting)!
-Make peace
    Make peace with a player you are hostile too. Better pay attention that
    your opponent makes peace too >:).

-Create a new guild
    This costs 2,000,000 Au. A guild will stay, even if the owner dies.
    The guild creator will receive a 'Guild Key' which designates him as the
    guild master. In case the guild master dies, another guild member may
    fetch the key to become the new guild master.
    (The guild creator used to receive Scrolls of House Creation. This has
    been removed for now, see (0.5).)
-Add player to guild
    Only the guild master or a dungeon wizard (administrator) can do this.
-Remove player from guild
    Only the guild master can do this. If all members are removed including
    the guild master, the guild ceases to exist and all houses the guild owns
    are wiped.
-Leave guild
    If the guild master leaves, the whole guild is disbanded.



(7) Tactics & strategy
======================
(7.1) Preparing the inventory for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will always want to stock up on certain
items before entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your
inventory:

Beginners (level 1)
---
+ Some Rations of Food, one or more Flask of Oil
Know that there are traps that can empty your stomach or drain the fuel of
your light. If you don't have supplies then you might be doomed.
+ Potion of Heroism
because it can approximately double the hitpoints of level 1 characters
(depending on race/class) for a short period of time as well as greatly
improve the chance to hit the opponent, which will raise the fighting
potential for example against enemies like Farmer Maggot's dogs. Even if your
character has a decent amount of Hit Points, these potions raise your fighting
abilities a good deal.
+ Potion of Cure Light Wounds
The become useless quickly while you gain some character levels since they
don't heal very many HP (Hit Points). At the beginning they are very helpful
however.
+ Scroll of Phase Door
This one does a short range teleportation, allowing you to escape if you are
surrounded or get some distance between an enemy and yourself, allowing you to
shoot him on distance using a ranged weapon. Since Phase Door teleports
randomly, you might have to read several of them quickly after each other
until you come out in a good position.
+ Maybe a scroll of Word-Of-Recall
If read in the dungeon it will far-distance teleport you back to the town.
This allows you to quickly "dive" deep and gain levels and find items that can
be sold for good cash, then read Word-Of-Recall to quickly get back home with
all the loot without having to start an annoying search for the staircases
leading upwards back to town.

Low level character (up to 15)
---
+ Several Rations of Food, Some Flasks of Oil
+ Some Potions of Heroism
+ Some Potions of Cure Serious Wounds / Critical Wounds
Note that Potions of Cure Critical Wounds also remove certain effects like
blindness and confusion!
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ Some Scrolls of Word-Of-Recall
+ Some Scrolls of Identify
These will allow you to identify unknown items that you may find!

Medium level character (up to 25)
---
+ Some Flasks of Oil. Replace rations of food with "Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger"
These will always fully satisfy your hunger and they are not eaten by rot
jellys ;) Lembas (elvish waybread) are also nice but very rare.
+ Many Potions of Cure Critical Wounds, maybe some Potions of Healing.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
These potions work similar to heroism, they rise your damage output instead of
your hit chance, allowing you to deal very extreme damage. Unfortunately they
are quite rare. If they are used together with potions of speed the result can
be devastating.
+ Several Scrolls of Word-Of-Recall
+ Several scrolls of Identify
Since you will encounter the more nice (or more dangerous..) loot the deeper
you descend, you will need a bunch of identification scrolls to find out what
is worth being kept and which items should be thrown away.
+ Some Potions of Speed
These will temporatily boost your global speed (movement/attack/cast) by +10.
In case you are moving at normal speed this means that your speed is doubled,
effectively doubling your combat power as well since you can shoot and hit
twice as fast now. These potions also allow to quickly retreat...
+ a Staff of Teleportation
This neat baby is your ticket out of most hazard situations where Phase Door
wouldn't help at all. However keep in mind that staves can be destroyed. So if
you consider a situation very dangerous and your staff of teleportation is
suddenly burned to ashes, you should think about reading Word-Of-Recall!
Unfortunately staves of teleportation are very expensive. Staves can be used
even while blind or confused!
+ You should have found some "Rods of Trap location"
Keep 2 or 3 of those with you. If you encounter a pit or vault you can easily
detect all the nasty traps inside. Rods of Door/Stair Location can also be
helpful.
+ Especially for clearing vaults you might find a staff of light, a wand of
trap/door destruction and maybe a wand of teleport other useful. However, that
would be 3 more inventory slots less to pick up loot :)

Higher characters (up to 35)
---
(If you came this far, good work!)
+ Some Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger or some Lembas if you can find enough. Some
flasks of oil if your light source needs those.
+ Lots of Potions of Cure Critical Wounds (20..40 for example), if possible
Potions of Healing instead of cure crits.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ a Rod of Recall
A rod cannot be destroyed by fire or acid, and you won't have to buy new
scrolls of WOR since the rod never runs out. Further, rods of recall are not
destroyed by traps, for example a "Trap of no return", which will burn all
your scrolls of WOR.
+ Lots of Scrolls of Identify (up to 99!). Maybe later on a Rod of Perception.
(I usually buy around 40 of them to make sure I don't miss some great loot ;)
A rod of perception does the same thing like a scroll of identify. A rod of
perception of quickness would be perfect. This one takes less time to
recharge!
+ Several Potions of Speed
+ Potions of Healing
These potions heal you way more than pots of cure critical wounds. However,
they are extremely expensive.
+ a Staff of Teleportation
+ 2 or 3 rods of trap location. Maybe a rod of door/stair location.
+ Some Scrolls of Teleportation, maybe even fireproof.
In case your staff is destroyed these scrolls serve as backup. If they are
fireproof they really are a good insurance. However, you cannot read while
blind or confused or if you stand in darkness. (Maybe someone invents scrolls
with magically heated letters that you can read in the dark if you have infra-
vision.. ;)
+ a "Sprigs of Athelas"
This one cures "Black Breath", which infects you if you fight a ring wraith!
You can leave the sprig in your house since Black Breath saps your soul very
slowly, so there should be enough time to finish business in the dungeon and
recall to town afterwards to eat a sprig.

Very high characters (36 and above)
---
+ Satisfy Hunger or Lembas
+ Lots of Potions of Cure Critical Wounds
If you manage to get enough Potions of Healing then you won't need pots of
cure critical wounds anymore.
+ Potions of Healing
+ Potions of Speed
+ Potions of Berserk Strength
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ (Fireproof) Scrolls of Teleportation
+ a Staff of Teleportation
+ a Rod of Recall
+ 2 or 3 Rods of Trap Location. Maybe a Rod of Door/Stair Location.
+ maybe a Rod of Illumination and a Rod of Disarming or Trap/Door Destruction
for clearing Vaults.
+ Sprigs of Athelas



(7.2) Preparing the equipment for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will need to equip certain items before
entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your equipment:

Beginners (level 1)
---
+ Lantern
because it provides light within a radius of 2 fields instead of 1 field of a
torch.
+ A ranged weapon as soon as possible
Don't forget the ammunition ;)
+ An appropriate melee weapon
Check out how many blows per round you get with a light "Whip (1d6)". If your
character has only one hit per round even with light weapons, choose a heavy
weapon that can deal more damage in one blow. If your character is low on
strength, pay attention that you don't buy a weapon that is too heavy.

Low level character (up to 15)
---
+ Enchant the damage of your melee and/or ranged weapon a bit using "Scrolls
of Enchant Weapon To-Dam"
+ Get some armor. Note that certain armor can decrease your dexterity or
spellcasting abilities, partially because it is too heavy. Also some weapons
will become less powerful if used together with a shield, and some weapons
cannot be used at all in conjunction with a shield. A fighter should have
approx. 30..45 AC or more.

Medium level character (up to 25)
---
+ Enchant your melee and ranged weapons to at least +8 to damage! Best would
be (+9,+9) or maybe even (+10,+10)
You might ask a very powerful priest or paladin to assist you, that way you
might save a great deal of money....
+ A fighter should have approx. 40..70 AC or more.
+ Get "Fear Resistance" also know as "Boldness"
+ Get Free Action.
It prevents you from being paralyzed by traps or attacks.
+ Get the 4 basic resistances, which are: Lightning/Electricity, Acid,
Frost/Cold, Fire/Heat
+ Consider buying a small house to store backup equipment or special items
instead of carrying them around with you.

Higher characters (up to 35)
---
+ A fighter should have approx. 65..100 AC or more.
+ Try to get a lantern of Brightness or even *Brightness*, a Dwarven Lantern
or a Feanorian Lamp. These provide more light and/or don't need to be fueled
and cannot be extincted. They can also have some special abilities like
preventing you from getting overwhelmed by fear!
+ Get "See Invisible" if possible. Some very nasty monsters are invisible and
"cold-blooded", that means they cannot be seen by infra-vision.
+ Get Poison Resistance! For example Boots of Mirkwood provide poison
resistance. Also Elven Armors often provide it. If you are trained in the art
of mimicry, you could try to use the form of a monster which has poison
resistance intrinsically.
+ Try to Get Confusion Resistance
Note that chaos resistance also provides confusion resistance.
+ Try to get Blindness Resistance
Helms or Caps of seeing give this!
+ Get Hold Life.
This prevents your life force from being drained, making you lose experience
and going back in character level. Cloaks of Teleri Hold Life and provide Free
Action.
+ Get powerful ego weapons
like Gondolins or *Defenders*. These will provide lots of resistances and
other abilities as well as deliver extra damage to certain monsters. Even if
they give you 1 blow less per round than your normal weapon you should
consider these.

Very high characters (36 and above)
---
+ A fighter should have at least 90 AC. He might also have already 130 AC at
level 36 if he is lucky.
+ Get as many high resistances as you can.. You will want Nether, Nexus,
Disenchantment, Chaos for example. Unfortunately there is no resistance
against Time, Inertia, Water and Mana (pure magical damage) attacks.. yet.
Note that "Feather Falling", also known as "Levitation" provides resistance
to gravity.
+ Get "See Invisible".
+ Get items that sustain your stats, for example a Robe of Permanence.
+ Get Randarts (randomly generated artifacts) or Artifacts (predefined
artifacts) as melee weapon
You will have to fight ring wraiths. Normal weapons, even those from Gondolin
or the most powerful *Defenders* will quickly shatter if they come in contact
with those unbelievably corrupted creatures of terror and hate. (I remember
one day I lost 4 Gondolins that way, pure fun.. ;) Your only way to fight them
is to equip an artifact since these resist ring wraiths greatly.
+ You will want items that permanently increase your speed!
+10 speed or +20 speed will make you approximately twice or three times as
fast as you usually are. Note that the curve will become flatter the higher
your speed is, so moving at more than +40 will hardly make a difference.



(7.3) Surviving critical situations
-----------------------------------
There are certain situations and constellations that will occur often in a
very similar manner. Here are some of them, together with some advice how
to manage it.

- a pack of approaching monsters (here orcs), often orcs or trolls:

#########   #  #
#  ooooo#   #  #
#  ooooo#####@ # <- stand there to intercept the incoming orcish horde.
#   ooooo oo   #    As soon as three or four of them stand on adjacent fields
#        o     #    move up one field to limit the attackers to 3 at a time.
#############  #    Sometimes the AI is very smart and monsters will try to
            #  #    surround you anyways. Phase door scrolls will help.

-sometimes packs of monsters, usually animals, retreat if you chase them in
 hallways, and will only attack if you enter a room. If these monsters don't
 have ranged attacks, just take them out with a bow or another range weapon.
 If you decide to chase them to the next room make sure you have enough phase
 door scrolls and healing pots to win a fight where you are attacked from all
 sides at once.

-the range of your missile weapon (bow) is often greater than monsters' range
 of sight as well as your own range of sight, allowing you to take out some
 monsters by shooting into the dark.

-If you open a door, especially doors to pits with unknown content, be very
 careful and open the door diagonally to have as little creatures as possible
 see you from inside the pit. If you open the door to a so-called "jelly pit"
 (contains icky-things, jellies, mold, mushroom patches) or a "water pit"
 (containing water ball/bolt shooting monsters) you might be insta-killed
 otherwise. Here is how to open the door:

###########
#,jmmjj,ii#@ <- stand here and open diagonally
#j,m,,mijm+  <- don't stand here or more monsters will see you from inside
###########

Prepare to close the door again as quickly as possible, it might be needed. In
general you should leave water pits and especially jelly pits alone!
Coin pits (lots of '$' inside) can also contain very powerful mimics!

-pack monsters can be very nasty if they can shoot or cast spells from behind.
 In that case you should make sure that only very few of them can see you at a
 time. If your health suddenly drops, teleport away at once.

-Sometimes it might be a good idea to use a "Stone-to-mud" or "Trap/Door
 destruction" spell to open a door from a distance.

-For weaker characters it might be a good idea to stay around 1000..1500 ft
 and try to get enough stat potions (potions that raise your six primary
 stats, STR INT WIS DEX CON CHR) until they have a considerably high amount
 of hit points and/or combat potential before they dive deeper!

Some monsters that people often get killed by are:

-Druid monsters, for example druid snotlings or druid kobolds. They can appear
 at very low level and they are able to cast firebolts that insta-kill you
 (instantly kill you).

-Elite Uruks, they fire extremely sharp arrows, always posing a high threat.

-Chieftain/Warrior/Monk/Unbeliever monsters of any kind. You will often see
 someone being killed by a hill troll monk or forest troll chieftain for
 example.. Prepare to hit your phase door macro if you spot a shimmering
 extraordinarily fast moving monster within a potentially dangerous mob.

-Veteran archer/Master archer monsters of any kind can pose a very high
 threat. Better get reflection ability if you are planning to fight these in
 a ranged duel.

-Hounds with breaths that need a high resistance or that cannot be resisted at
 all.

-Dark elven Warlocks. These belong to the few monsters that can cast mana
 bolts, which inflict very high damage. Even worse, DEW (Dark Elven Warlocks)
 can appear in packs. Beware!

-Colbrans. These are the lowest monsters that can "reflect". This means that
 missiles or magical bolt spells will be reflected onto the caster, which can
 insta-kill weak wizards that use hi-damage spells. (Note: Monster reflection
 was removed a while ago, so you don't have to worry about this one for now.)

-Will o' the wisps are very hard to spot and catch, their curses are
 devastating.

-The Glass Golem drives everyone insane whom it manages to hit, high AC helps.

-Drolems. A constructed dragon that will breathe poison for high damage and
 takes a lot of hits before ceasing to function.

-The Stormbringer, an animated blade that bears mad fury within. It swings
 so powerful that it can knockout its enemies with ease. Defeating it,
 however, will make it usable to its defeater!

The most powerful representant of each class:
-Ranger chieftains are tough opponents who can nail you on the spot and
 use magic attacks as well as summon.
-Knight Templars, powerful paladins who are immune to holy attacks and
 are even able to call an angel for support.
-Patriarchs, these unfaltering priestlords can summon and curse rapidly.
-Master Mindcrafters, their ability to summon mighty support and to smash
 your brain by psi attacks is feared.
-Old sorcerors are able to summon ancient dragonkind and wyrms, beware!
-(Grand) Swordsmasters, most skilled swordsmen that will disarm you easily.
-(Grand) Master mystics, most powerful martial artists. With their special
 techniques they can manage to stun you easily. Best remedy is high AC so
 they won't hit you in the first place. Alternatively you can quaff potions
 to remove any stun effect.
-(Grand) Master thieves, very fast and stealthy they steal your possessions!

-The most powerful monsters of the daemon realm, the dragonkind and the
 heavenly planes, namely Star-spawns of Cthulu, Great Wyrms of Power,
 balance keepers of the skies, sun and stars (Blades).

-Further, players are often killed if they lack resistances and/or free action
 (against paralyzation) but nevertheless dive down into the dungeon very
 quickly.

-Unique enemies. If you see a monster blinking in different colours, before
 trying to kill it you should examine the text file "r_info.txt" located in
 the lib\game directory to find out if it is a certain unique enemy. Then look
 up his abilities and make sure you are prepared to fight him.

-If you see an enemy that you don't know anything about and that could pose a
 threat (especially if it's inside a vault!), STAY AWAY and consult either an
 experienced player or look into the file r_info.txt in your tomenet/lib/game
 directory to find out what the opponent is capable of. The safest (and most
 boring and least rewarding) way to play is to avoid vaults! Vaults can
 contain an enemy against which you don't have the slightest chance of beating
 it.

-Teleport out of trouble
 If you are not an antimagic-user, you should buy a staff of teleportation as
 soon as possible since it can take you out of dangerous situations.
 However, the staff is no guarantee :)
 After you bought it, try if you can actually use it well or if you keep
 failing! If you're not good at magic devices you might have to spend points
 into your 'Magic Device' skill.
 I recommend to always have at least 3 charges in the staff before diving into
 the dungeon.

-Quaff potions of cure critical wounds or healing if you get (heavily) stunned
 to prevent a lethal knockout in the next round! Further you can't use martial
 arts special techniques while stunned, cutting your damage a lot.
 Get sound resistance to not waste potions to cure stun effects from
 water/sound/gravity/ice/plasma attacks.

-Don't wait till you are a '1' or '0' before you try to teleport out.
 If you want to be on the safe side, teleport out when you are a '4' or '3'.
 Remember that your teleport staff may fail sometimes or that enemies may
 stun you for several turns!

-Before AND after a larger fight, check your inventory if you can carry on
 or if you have to return to town to stock up. A common problem is that some
 monsters can empty or burn up your teleport items, which you might overlook.

-If you are surrounded by huge piles of loot from dead monsters you might be
 tempted to drop cheaper items like phase door scrolls to make room for the
 precious loot, and go /afk to wait for pseudo-id. However, know that you
 _can_ all of a sudden be ambushed during that time by enemies. By enemies
 that _require_ you to use phase door..

-I do not recommend to drop food nor oil in exchange for loot if you're not
 planning to recall instantly after you picked up the loot.

-Learn from your mistakes. If you die, think about if you were taking too high
 a risk, and check if you overlooked anything, maybe you were missing
 essential items (cure critical w. potions to get rid of confusion/blindness).
 Next time, be more careful. Playing TomeNET means learning a lot about the
 monsters/items.

-Team up with fellow players that are approximately at your character level.
 This means more fun and less danger. Your teammates can save your life.



(7.4) Spoiler files
-------------------
In the folder tomenet-bin/lib/game you find several data files containing
various information about all monsters, items and other features of TomeNET.
These files are named X_info.txt and can be read via a normal text editor.
The most important files are:
r_info.txt  contains all monsters.
k_info.txt  contains all base item types.
e_info.txt  contains all ego item types.
a_info.txt  contains all artifacts.
All files contain a block of information, either at the beginning or at the
end, which explains the meaning of each discrete info-line.



(8) Miscellanous
================
(8.1) 'The Art Not To Die'
--------------------------
You died. Hm, very annoying indeed. If you are a "No-ghost" or "Hellish"
character, then you are wiped out now. Otherwise you became a ghost on the
same dungeon level as you died on. Your items are scattered on the floor, now
what to do? The items will disappear forever if you leave that dungeon level
and noone remains down there to "keep it static", as the technical term is. If
you think you really need the items, ask someone to get down on your dungeon
level and either revive you there using a scroll of life or pick up your items
and give them back to you in the town. If your level is still very low, you
can just decide to suicide and start over. That is sometimes easier.
In TomeNET you will often encounter new situations that can lead to death. The
most important thing here is that you really keep in mind your mistakes of the
past to prevent them from happening again. In my opinion playing TomeNET can
be called "the art not to die".



(8.2) Character Dumps
---------------------
You should send in character dumps, if you have reached an intermediate level,
to http://angband.oook.cz/ ! You can create a character dump by invoking the
character screen by pressing 'C' and then pressing 'f' (as it states at the
bottom). These dumps are always interesting to see. Your character doesn't need
to have achieved a high level for sending in a dump. Every level is fine.
Character dumps are automatically created in your /tomenet-bin/lib/user folder
if your character dies. The filename is charactername-death.txt, for example
Gandalf-death.txt. (no overwrite-check is performed.)



(8.3) Golem creation
---------------------
Players can create golems, mindless animated humanoids that will fight for
them. Monsters won't attack golems, but the controlling players. To create a
golem, you will need these parts:

A 'scroll of Golem Creation'
A massive piece of a specific material
Arms, up to 4.
Legs, at least 2, can be up to 30 (a centipede-style golem!)

To control the golem, you will need 3 controlling scrolls. These won't be
read, but activated! On activation ('A') they toggle the golem's behaviour.
The scrolls are:

A 'Golem Scroll of Guard'
A 'Golem Scroll of Following'
A 'Golem Scroll of Attack'

If you have gathered all these items in your inventory, read the scroll of
golem creation! The golem will only listen to commands of a scroll which
was in your inventory when you read the scroll of golem creation, so make
sure you carry all 3 controlling scrolls before creating it.

Each arm will inflict (x)d(3 + arm value) damage on a target.
The arm value is displayed in brackets, part of the item name.
The 'x' are listed in the materials table below.
Example: A 'Golem Arm (+8)' of an 'Iron Golem' will do 9d(3+8) damage, so
9d11, which means the damage per hit varies randomly from 9 up to 99.
Each leg will increase the golem's speed by the number displayed on the leg.
A golem with 30 legs can be *FAST*, but keep in mind that more than 40..50
speed won't do much of a difference since speed effect in general decreases at
very high values.

The material determines armour class, hit points and the damage dice count of
the golem. Materials are:
    Wood             20 AC,  10d10 hit dice,  3 damage dice.
    Copper           40 AC,  10d20 hit dice,  6 damage dice.
    Iron             70 AC,  10d40 hit dice,  9 damage dice.
    Aluminium        90 AC,  10d60 hit dice, 12 damage dice.
    Silver          100 AC,  10d70 hit dice, 15 damage dice.
    Gold            130 AC,  10d80 hit dice, 18 damage dice.
    Mithril         160 AC, 10d100 hit dice, 21 damage dice.
    Adamantite      210 AC, 10d150 hit dice, 24 damage dice.
Some rumours say that the highest materials can only be found on even deeper
dungeons than where Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness resides.

If the creator inscribes items in his inventory with '@G' and then creates a
golem, those items will be transferred to the golem (careful, they cannot be 
retrieved!) and fuse with it, bestowing it with their abilities.
The following rules are applied:
-An item 'of life (+x)' increases the hit dice number by x.
-An item that raises the player's speed by x speeds the golem up by 2 / 3 * x.
-An item that improves the player's tunneling ability bestows the KILL_WALL
ability upon the golem.
-An item that gives fire or acid resitance will make the golem immune(!) to
fire or acid.
-An item that gives nether or nexus or disenchantment resistance will give
the according resistance to the golem.
All other items/abilities have no effect.

Golems can't be detected by ESP, they regenerate quickly, they are powerful
and can push past weaker monsters, they can bash doors. They can dig through
rock, they are immune to cold, electricity and poison, they don't know fear
and can neither be confused nor paralyzed. They are immune to teleportation
attacks. Golems have always the maximum possible hit dice. Further, golems
count as '100 %clones', hence giving no experience if someone kills them.
Golems always attack by hitting with their arms for raw physical damage.
A golem has the same level as its owner had at the time of creation.
Golem owners don't get experience for monsters killed by the golem.

If the scroll of attack is toggled, the golem will attack its master's current
target.
If the scroll of guard is toggled, the golem will start attacking the monster
with the most HP on its adjacent fields (those are the 8 fields around it;
if those are empty, it just waits).
If the scroll of following is toggled, the golem will just follow its master.
If a scroll is read although the according state is already active, the golem
will stop doing that.

Last but not least, the golem is..
-following you on staircases up/downwards.
-transported with you by word of recall.
-not transported by normal teleportation.
-saved if you exit the game.
-the golem will never attack other players unless you set them to hostile via
the party menu ('P'). If they are hostile, the same rules as for monsters
apply (see the description of the 3 command scrolls above).



(8.4) Troubleshooting
---------------------
PROBLEM 01: I don't get to see a server list when I start TomeNET.
            Instead, I am immediately asked for account and password.
SOLUTION:   This is a typical problem on Windows XP. There are 3
            possible fixes:
            -Use 'Win98 Compatibility Mode' (Create a link from tomenet4.exe,
             right-click it, choose 'properties', choose 'Compatibility'.
             This option is available natively on Windows XP systems; for
             Windows 2000 systems first try the other two points mentioned
             below, if they don't help, get the compatibility mode update
             from www.microsoft.com or from www.c-blue.de/appupd.exe ).
            -Move the 'tomenet-bin' directory to your drive's root. For
             example C:\tomenet-bin\.. .
            -to edit your "tomenet4.ini" file and specify a host directly by
             specifying "HOST=europe.tomenet.net".
PROBLEM 02: I get to a server list, but it doesn't show any servers. It just
            says 'Press Q to enter a server manually' and that's it.
SOLUTION:   There are 2 possible solutions.
            -There is currently no public TomeNET server running. That can
             happen if a server update is currently being applied or if for
             some reason the server just crashed. Try again after a minute.
            -There are some DNS problems. These can happen for various reasons
             although they aren't very likely. DNS problems can last for a
             longer period of time though, being very annoying.
             That the server isn't listed doesn't mean that it's down though.
             You should try to connect manually (press 'Q') to either:
             europe.tomenet.net
             or (if that doesn't work either) directly to its IP address:
             213.186.35.70
PROBLEM 03: All windows except for the main window stay empty. (occurs on
            Windows XP machines).
SOLUTION:   Open tomenet4.ini file with a text editor, look for the window
            sections, change the fonts to the same settings (8x13) as in the
            [Main window] section: FontFile=8X13.FON , Font=8X13.FON .
            Also, you could adjust the width/height of the windows (to 80x24
            for example). Try other fonts too, maybe they work for you.
PROBLEM 04: I cannot browse (some) spell books, I see some LUA error messages
            if I try or when I connect to the server.
SOLUTION:   Your LUA script files are outdated. Those files are responsible
            for any spell-casting and some other things.
            To update them, you have 2 possibilities:
            -Automatic update: Join the server, you should see a message in
             the chat window, saying that (some of) your LUA files are being
             updated. After all files have been successfully received (a
             green message will say so for each file) you need to exit and
             re-enter the server in order for them to take effect.
            -The first method doesn't work for everyone. Another possibility
             is to just download a ZIP file containing the latest scripts
             and extract it to your /tomenet-bin/lib/scpt folder.
             You can get the latest scripts at www.c-blue.de/rogue.html .
PROBLEM 05: When I start TomeNET I don't see anything except a small hollow
            yellow rectangle (the cursor). All windows stay black. It seems
            that the cursor reacts to my inputs by printing out some black
            hence invisible text.
SOLUTION:   A rare problem that is not caused by TomeNET really. Restart your
            MS Windows system and the text should be visible again.
PROBLEM 06: TomeNET seems to freeze up while playing.
SOLUTION:   This can happen if your latency is relatively high and many
            messages are transported between the server and your client.
            In fact it's just your display that freezes up. In that state
            you can for example type a chat message and other players
            will read it.
            Quit the game and join again to continue playing.
            Or just start another instance of the game and log in, that will
            override the old connection, making your client quit with
            "resume connection" message.
PROBLEM 07: I am disconnected during gameplay.
SOLUTION:   This can have several reasons. On disconnection a message box will
            appear, telling you about the problem. The following messages
            might occur:
            "client quit"
                    This just shows up if you regularly quit your client.
            "Committed suicide"
                    You just committed suicide..
            "resume conneection"
                    This happens if you try to log in the same character with
                    two TomeNET clients at once, the older client will quit
                    and the client that just logged in will take over.
            "Killed by..."
                    Your character was finally killed/destroyed.
            "Starving to death"
                    If this happens in town, your life will be saved if you
                    had full HP. Otherwise you died to starvation.
            "Timeout 08"
                    This happens if you 'lag out' on a slow connection or if
                    the server or your computer is under very heavy load.
            "Panic save failed"
                    This means the server just crashed and even failed to save
                    the characters :(. It will usually be back online after a
                    minute or earlier.
            "Panic save succeded"
                    This means the server just crashed :(. It will usually
                    be back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save succeeded)"
                    The server was shut down regularly. It will usually be
                    back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save failed!)"
                    The server was shut down regularly but saving the
                    characters failed for some reason (insufficient disk
                    space). It will usually be back online after a minute or
                    earlier.
            "banned for ..."
                    You were banned temporarily from the server (includes
                    being kicked out).
            "kicked out"
                    You were kicked out of the server.
            "read error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "write error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "flush error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "receive error in play"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
PROBLEM 08: I am disconnected from the server with an error message, this
            happens before I can even start playing.
SOLUTION:   Read the error message displayed in a message box on quitting.
            Here is a list of possible errors and solutions:
            "Your name is too long!"
                    Don't use names longer than 15 characters.
            "Your name contains control chars!"
                    Don't use control chars in your name.
            "No such character"
                    Your client tried to log in with a
                    non-existant character (shouldn't happen).
            "You are temporarily banned"
                    Self-explaining.
            "disconnect in login"
                    Don't take too long for your character
                    creation or you might time out.
            "login failure"
                    A wrong account or password was entered.
            "Name already owned"
                    Account name already exists.
            "Your client is outdated"
                    Download the latest client, see (0.1).
            "Server responds 'Unknown client version'"
                    The server might be running an older
                    version than your client is.
            "Sorry, the game is full."
                    Wow the game is really full!
            "That nickname is already in use."
                    Choose a different character name.
            "The server didn't like your nickname, realname or hostname"
                    Player characters are identified by 3 names:
                    -Nickname (character's name)
                    -Realname (account name)
                    -Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
                    The hostname is not really important. However, make sure
                    that all of these 3 names may only consist of letters,
                    numbers, spaces, and all other characters with an ASCII
                    code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
                    The realname and hostname must not be empty. The nickname
                    (character name) needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z'
                    or 'a'..'z').
            "There is already another character from this user/machine.."
                    You tried to login with two characters from the same
                    account or machine simultaneously, which is usually
                    forbidden.
            "Sorry, the server is for members only."
                    Log in with 'guest'. You need to get an account for this
                    private server in order to play. 
PROBLEM 09: I can't connect to the meta-server (the server that displays you
            a list of online TomeNET servers) or a specific TomeNET server.
            Instead my connection seems to time-out.
SOLUTION:   If you are behind a firewall make sure that the TCP ports
            8801 for metaserver and 18348 for the actual TomeNET server aren't
            blocked. (Well, the metaserver isn't needed to play - specify the
            game server via command-line or when asked for it after starting
            up the game then.)
PROBLEM 10: I'm not blocked by a firewall, but I still don't see the
            metaserver when I run Tomenet. Instead after waiting for a short
            period of time I'm asked to enter a server manually.
SOLUTION:   The meta-server might be down or a DNS problem might be occuring
            right now. This can happen from time to time. You don't need the
            meta-server to play TomeNET though.
            Just type in the IP adress of the server you'd like to connect to,
            for europe enter:   213.186.35.70
            Make sure your tomenet4.ini file contains the correct server port,
            usually 18348! This port isn't needed if you use the meta-list to
            choose a server to connect to, but it's important if you connect
            directly!
            You can connect directly to a TomeNET server and skip the meta
            server list by running your Tomenet directly from the command-line
            (DOS window) within its folder, adding the server IP as a
            parameter. (In windows2k choose START/Run... and type 'cmd'
            without quotation marks to open a command-line window.
            Alternatively you can create a shortcut from your tomenet4.exe by
            right-clicking, dragging, releasing it. Edit this shortcut's
            properties and add the server IP to the command-line.)
            For europe server it would look like this:
            tomenet4.exe 213.186.35.70
